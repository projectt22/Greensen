										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This month has been dubbed <a href="https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plastic Free July</a> and you may have read articles this year about people trying to live <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/26/nx-s1-5021546/plastic-free-sustainable-living-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/12/my-no-plastic-life-i-tried-to-cut-out-single-use-items-for-a-month-and-it-almost-broke-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic</a> for a week – and finding out that it’s all but impossible. Single-use plastics are everywhere. Why is that a problem and what can be done about it?<br></p>



<p><strong>1. What is the problem with plastic?</strong></p>



<p><br>Plastic pollution is everywhere, from the 36,000-foot-deep <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plastic-bag-found-bottom-worlds-deepest-ocean-trench/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mariana Trench</a>&nbsp; to the peak of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount Everest</a>. And plastic is not just polluting places, it’s polluting the bodies of animals too, including humans. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/climate/seabirds-plastic-contamination-crunchy-australia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">778 pieces of plastic were found in the body of one seabird</a>.</p>



<p>Microplastics are now found throughout the human body and levels are especially concentrated in the brain. Adding to the concern, recent studies have found that <a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-human-brains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accumulation of plastic in the brain</a> is growing in parallel with plastic waste in the environment, while according to the Pew Charitable Trust, if business as usual continues, plastic flows into oceans will <a href="https://www.pew.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triple by 2040</a>.</p>



<p><br><strong>2. What is the solution?</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Reduce!</strong> Step one: we need to use WAY less single-use plastic. We can do this by eliminating unnecessary plastic or substituting it for less harmful material like fiber.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reuse! </strong>Reusable packaging can either be made of plastic or other materials. In this case, instead of using the packaging once, it can be used, sanitized, and used again. Think Coca-Cola bottles. In many countries, including parts of Europe and South America, Coca-Cola sells its products in bottles that are used again and again, instead of using a bottle once and throwing it out. Refillable glass bottles can be <a href="https://upstreamsolutions.org/blog/nre-bottle-refill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reused about 50 times</a>!</p>



<p><br><strong>Recycle! </strong>Although most plastics are not widely recycled, recycling also plays a role in reducing plastic use. Companies are reducing their use of virgin plastic by using more recycled plastic.</p>



<p><br><strong>3. Can’t we just recycle our way out of this problem?</strong></p>



<p><br>No. While paper and metals are highly recyclable materials that can be recycled over and over again, it is harder to recycle plastic and as a result the recycling rate for plastic is only about <a href="https://stories.undp.org/why-arent-we-recycling-more-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9%</a>. Additionally, recycling plastic actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/recycled-plastic-more-toxic-no-fix-pollution-greenpeace-warns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases health risks</a> by exposing local communities to toxic air emissions and increasing the toxicity of the plastic itself.</p>



<p><br><strong>4. So, what can you do?</strong></p>



<p>The good news is that there is a LOT we can do to reduce our use of plastic to protect the planet and our health. Here are some things individuals can do:</p>



<ul>
<li>Choose products that have less or no plastic packaging</li>



<li>Buy “used” rather than “new” when you can – whether it’s thrifting (yes, clothes contain plastic!) or toys for your kids, keeping new material out of the waste stream drives down demand for new plastic.</li>



<li>Tell the stores you shop at that you want to buy products without plastic packaging or that have reusable or refillable packaging.</li>



<li><a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/resources/how-young-environmentalists-can-help-tackle-the-plastic-pollution-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kids can protect the environment from plastic too</a>!</li>



<li>Urge your representatives to support effective legislation to cut plastic, including:<ul><li><a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/extended-producer-responsibility/epr-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extended producer responsibility</a> (EPR) laws, which make companies pay for the plastic waste they create;</li></ul><ul><li>Bottle bills, which pay customers to bring back bottles and have been shown to increase recycling rates;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Plastics bag bans, which have also been found to significantly <a href="https://grist.org/science/plastic-bag-ban-beach-cleanups-ocean-conservancy-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce the amount of plastic bags found in the environment</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><br>And if you’re a corporation that uses plastic, you can: reduce, reuse, recycle – in that order!</p>



<ul>
<li>First, make sure that you are only using essential plastic packaging.</li>



<li>Then, offer products in reusable packaging where appropriate.</li>



<li>Finally, for cases where you cannot eliminate or reuse the packaging, use packaging that is made from recycled plastic material.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br>What is Green Century doing about plastics?</strong></p>



<p>As the manager of the Green Century Funds, Green Century Capital Management engages companies with large plastic footprints to press them to reduce their use of plastic. For example, Green Century convinced hotel chains Marriott, Hilton, and Choice Hotels to <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/why-are-big-brands-reducing-plastic/">reduce their use of single use plastics</a>. Because most plastic ends up in landfills and incinerators, we also engage with companies to make sure their recyclability claims don’t mislead consumers. For example, we got Starbucks to commit to ensure that its plastic <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/starbucks-to-expand-disclosure-on-reuse-assess-plastic-recyclability-labels/">recyclability labels</a> are accurate.</p>



<p><br><strong>Is this problem going to get solved?</strong></p>



<p><br>It is not all doom and gloom. A UNEP report found that we can <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/42277/Plastic_pollution.pdf?sequence=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce global plastic pollution by 80%</a> by 2040 – but collective action is key. 175 nations will meet in Geneva, Switzerland in August 2025 to negotiate a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02064-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global plastics treaty</a>. Our elected representatives in states across the country can and have passed laws that reduce plastic. Companies can act quickly on this, at the urging of investors, customers, and civil society organizations. We can turn this ship around, but we all need to get rowing in the same direction. Green Century will continue to push companies to cut plastic and build a truly circular economy on the one planet we’ve got.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We’re excited to share that our award-winning Green Century° team achieved 11 new environmental policy victories during the 2024-2025 shareholder season to protect forests, reduce climate change pollution, cut single-use plastics and more. We also saw 18 policies implemented that companies had previously committed to adopting this year – thanks to our advocacy.</p>



<p>Below are our Top Ten Highlights from the 2025 Shareholder Advocacy Season.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="518" height="345" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26810" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy.jpeg 518w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></figure>



<p>10. Preserving Forests: J.M. Smucker*, parent company of Folgers and Dunkin’ at Home coffee products, agreed to review its forest protection policies with an ambition of eventually sourcing all of its ingredients without causing any deforestation. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, which requested that the company ensure its supplies of coffee, palm, soy and cocoa, as well as wood pulp used for its packaging, are deforestation free. The company plans to follow the assessment with a transition to deforestation-free supplies in 2026.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="551" height="367" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26807" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1.jpeg 551w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px" /></figure>



<p>9. Safeguarding Animal Welfare: Green Century filed a shareholder proposal asking Darden Restaurants* to eliminate the use of gestation crates for pigs. Gestation crates are considered inhumane and enable factory farming systems that increase pollution. The resolution received a significant 20% vote in support from investors and, if adopted, would put Darden on par with companies such as Bloomin&#8217; Brands<em>, Costco</em> and Target* that are phasing out gestation crates in their supply chains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="512" height="341" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26806" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3.jpeg 512w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure>



<p>8. Protecting Biodiversity: Green Century filed a shareholder resolution at Conagra* urging the packaged food company to strengthen protections for wild lands as it sources ingredients such as beef and soy. In exchange for withdrawal of our shareholder proposal, Conagra committed to assessing more protections for biodiverse ecosystems such as grasslands and savannahs affected by its global supply chain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="537" height="358" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26805" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4.jpeg 537w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></figure>



<p>7. Disclosing Climate Impact: In response to a Green Century shareholder proposal and subsequent agreement, Lowe’s Home Improvement* released climate emissions data from the products it sells. These new disclosures represent 84% of Lowe’s contribution to climate change and will show investors the categories that represent the biggest polluters, allowing stakeholders to press the company more effectively on how it plans to mitigate its climate impact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="487" height="323" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26804" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5.jpeg 487w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5-300x199.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></figure>



<p>6. Stopping Plastic Pollution: Green Century reached an agreement with Starbucks* to ensure the coffee behemoth provides accurate information about the recyclability of its plastic cups and shares details about its transition to reusable cups by early 2026. Sealed Air*<em>, the packaging company that sells BUBBLE WRAP® and air pillows, </em>and packaging company Amcor* also agreed to improve the sustainability of their packaging to ensure their recycling labels do not mislead consumers. All three commitments came after Green Century agreed to withdraw related shareholder proposals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="543" height="362" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26803" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6.jpeg 543w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></figure>



<p>5. Protecting Farm Animal Welfare: Jack in the Box* hit its benchmark to source 25% of its pork from pigs raised in “open pens” instead of gestation crates by the end of 2024. This interim target, up from 0% at the end of 2023, is an important step toward the company’s goal to source 100% of its pork that way by 2026 as outlined in an agreement with Green Century° in 2023. Gestation crates are controversial because they harm animals and can also damage a company’s reputation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="432" height="288" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26802" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7.jpeg 432w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></figure>



<p>4. Reducing Single-use Plastic: Coca-Cola*, the largest soft drink company in the world, committed to disclosing its investments and successes in reusable bottle initiatives in response to a Green Century° shareholder proposal. The company also agreed to continue to disclose quantitatively the share of beverages it sells in reusable containers. These commitments will help investors track the company’s efforts to mitigate plastic-related risks and push for progress.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="630" height="420" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26801" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8.jpeg 630w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></figure>



<p>3. Protecting the Climate: Green Century filed 12 climate-related shareholder proposals this year at major companies ranging from Amazon* to McDonald&#8217;s*<em>,</em> pressing the companies to disclose their full contribution to climate change, targets to reduce it, and plans to achieve those targets. We filed one of those resolutions at TD Bank* which led to the company pledging to evaluate its plans to reduce its carbon footprint as part of a broader governance review and clarify the climate expertise on its board.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="508" height="381" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26799" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10.jpeg 508w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></figure>



<p>2. Preserving Tropical Forests: Costco*, the third largest retailer in the world, will publish a comprehensive assessment and action plan to reduce deforestation in its Kirkland Signature brand products, protecting threatened species such as the jaguar and giant otter. Costco committed to publish the plan by 2025 after dialogue and withdrawal of a related shareholder proposal by Green Century°.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="643" height="429" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26798" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11.jpeg 643w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></figure>



<p>1. Conserving Nature: The Okefenokee is the largest blackwater swamp in North America and one of the largest intact freshwater ecosystems in the world. Since 2021, Green Century° has pressed chemical company Chemours* to avoid mining near the Okefenokee. Our advocacy amplified public backlash that helped push mining company Twin Pines Minerals, which had previously contracted with Chemours, to sell its Okefenokee-adjacent land to a conservation group instead. Green Century°&#8217;s related 2025 biodiversity resolution at Chemours won enough support to refile in future years and help keep mining away from the Okefenokee.</p>

<p>Green Century’s shareholder advocacy team as well as religious, legal, and other groups helped amplify a public outcry that halted a proposed mine near the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/okefenokee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Okefenokee </a>National Wildlife Refuge, a wild and ecologically rare swamp in Georgia. The Conservation Fund recently purchased nearly 8,000 acres of land near the Okefenokee for abou<a href="https://environmentamerica.org/articles/why-georgias-okefenokee-swamp-needs-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">t $60 million from Twin Pines Minerals LLC.</a></p>



<p>This is a monumental win not only for the state of Georgia, but for all those who voiced support for these wetlands.</p>



<p>For each of the past four years, Green Century’s award-winning shareholder advocacy team has opposed a proposed titanium mine in this wildlife haven that boasts the largest freshwater swamp in the country. &nbsp;Green Century’s efforts to protect this natural treasure include<ins>d</ins> filing shareholder resolutions, speaking with the media, and holding several webinars to highlight its importance.</p>



<p>The Okefenokee is the largest wildlife refuge in the Eastern United States and provides critical habitat to more than 400 animal species. The swamp is also a massive carbon sink, holding more than <a href="https://www.selc.org/topic/protecting-the-okefenokee-swamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">140 million tons of carbon dioxide</a>, which is roughly equivalent to the emissions from 30 million cars.</p>



<p>For years, Twin Pines Minerals sought permits to mine titanium dioxide—a white pigment used in paint<del>s</del>, toothpaste, and sunscreen<del>s</del>—on lands bordering the swamp. &nbsp;In 2022, Green Century secured a commitment from Chemours*, a chemical company linked to Twin Pines, to refrain from mining in the area in the near term. Mining operations there pose severe threats to the swamp and its surrounding ecosystems, including water pollution, soil degradation, and the destruction of critical wildlife habitats.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In 2025, Green Century again pressed Chemours to avoid mining at the Okefenokee by filing a shareholder proposal asking for a biodiversity assessment before the company mines in ecologically sensitive areas. The proposal won enough support to refile in future years and raised important visibility for the issue among investors.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This and other Green Century wins demonstrate the power that shareholder advocacy wields. &nbsp;Green Century is ready to take on the next challenge and will continue leveraging our investors&#8217; support to hold global corporations accountable and protect our environment.</p>

<p>Did you know that every three bites of food you consume is linked to a bee, butterfly, hummingbird, beetle or other pollinator?</p>



<p>Green Century&#8217;s partner, <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a>, has drawn attention to the use of harmful pesticides that contribute to the decline of bees and other pollinators during the late-June National Pollinator Week.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:28% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img decoding="async" width="294" height="227" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2025-07-01-173904.png" alt="" class="wp-image-26686 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>Bees and other pollinators face increasing threats, including loss of habitat, a warming climate, disease and the wider use of toxic pesticides known as neonicotinoids. Commonly called “neonics”, this class of insecticides is widely used in gardening and farming. </p>



<p>Neonics are absorbed by the entire plant’s system &#8211; from roots to pollen &#8211; making them especially harmful to pollinators.</p>

<p>Neonics are considered <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/insect-apocalypse-under-way-toxic-pesticides-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a thousand times more toxic to bees than DDT</a>, according to a National Geographic article, and the residue can taint soil, water, and other elements of the environment. In the U.S., neonics are used to coat seeds, including corn, soy, cotton and plants from garden centers. Beekeepers started noticing population declines about the same time as the expansion of neonic use.</p>

<li>Some states, including <a href="https://val.vtecostudies.org/projects/vtbees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vermont with its 350-plus species of wild bees,</a> and New York have curtailed the sale of seeds coated with neonics.</li>



<li>Twelve states bar the application of neonics by people who don’t possess a pesticide applicator’s permit from purchasing the insecticide. Alphabetically, these states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.</li>



<li>Minnesota and California have blocked the use of neonics in state wildlife areas and on other public lands, reflecting the belief that these areas should be some of the safest places for bees, butterflies, birds, and other critters.</li>

<p>Environment America is working with state leaders and like-minded organizations to restrict the sale of neonics, curtail sale of neonic-treated seeds, block the use of neonics on state lands, and encourage planting of pollinator friendly plants on roads and on state lands. Green Century is a key supporter of Environment America, with the two organizations aligned in efforts to preserve biodiversity, and working for environmental protections and a healthy planet. </p>

<p><strong>Boston, June 26, 2025</strong> – Conagra Brands*, the parent company of Orville Redenbacher’s, Duncan Hines, Slim Jim and other well-known food brands will assess whether it should replicate the nature and biodiversity protections it employs in forests in non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco in Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.</p>



<p>“Food companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It’s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.”</p>



<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat</strong></p>



<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina. The Cerrado alone, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% of all species</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on Earth, has lost </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million acres of natural savanna</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in recent decades</a>. This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.</p>



<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection</strong></p>



<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company’s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;It’s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, June 20, 2025 – </strong><a href="https://www.conservationfund.org/our-impact/press-room/the-conservation-fund-halts-okefenokee-mining-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Conservation Fund</a> announced Friday that it had purchased land and mineral rights near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge from Twin Pines Minerals, LLC. The mining company had proposed a strip mine roughly three miles from the edge of the Okefenokee, the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/okefenokee/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest National Wildlife Refuge in the eastern</a> United States. </p>



<p>The proposed titanium mine could have contaminated Georgia’s most famous swamp,&nbsp;threatened the biodiversity-rich ecosystem, and <a href="https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Letter_RD%20to%20GA-EPD_TwinPines%20Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heightened the chances of wildfires.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For four years,<strong> </strong>Green Century° has pressed companies to avoid mining or selling products containing materials mined at the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Twin Pines’ move to sell this land only reinforces our position that mining at the Okefenokee quite simply isn’t worth the risks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a price tag of nearly $60 million, The Conservation Fund will acquire about 8,000 acres of land and the underlying mineral rights from Twin Pines Minerals, which had prior contractual relations with Chemours, located near the swamp that includes a section where the company had proposed a roughly 600-acre titanium mine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>The Okefenokee is a global biodiversity hotspot, freshwater wetland, and carbon sink</strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last fall, Green Century Capital Management and the Felician Sisters of North America Endowment Trust&nbsp;filed a shareholder resolution asking chemical company Chemours* to assess potentially irreversible biodiversity impacts before mining in ecologically sensitive areas, including at the Okefenokee. Most of Chemours&#8217; mining operations lie in a global biodiversity hotspot, where mining-related impacts such as water pollution and habitat degradation are particularly destructive. The proposal received sufficient investor support to refile in future years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As one of the largest freshwater <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wetlands</a> in the world, a massive carbon sink, and home to over 1,000 species of plants and animals, the Okefenokee is the last place we should be mining for anything,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century</strong>. “We applaud today’s news that this national treasure is one step closer to protection from harmful and unnecessary mining.”&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					
<p></p>



<p>Boston, June 19, 2025 – Amcor*, one of the largest plastic packaging companies in the world, has agreed to assess whether its recycled content claims create financial risks for the company, and if so, to take corrective action. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, which withdrew the proposal in exchange for Amcor’s commitment.</p>



<p><br>“We applaud Amcor for taking steps to ensure its recycled content claims aren’t misleading,” <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>, <strong>President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Investors need comprehensive and transparent disclosure of business risks in order to protect their investments.”</p>



<p><br><strong>Recycled content is good – but ‘mass balance accounting’ obscures the facts</strong></p>



<p><br>The use of recycled content in packaging is a key way to prevent new plastic from entering the environment. However, some companies, including Amcor, use a method called “mass balance accounting” to calculate recycled content. This alternative method can be used by companies to <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/renee-sharp/plastics-industrys-latest-deception-mass-balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim that a majority of a piece of packaging is made from recycled content</a> in cases when traditional accounting methods would put that number at less than 10%. Consequently, mass balance accounting is potentially misleading to consumers, which can create compliance risks for companies since misleading environmental claims are illegal in the <a href="https://earth.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-eus-new-greenwashing-directive/#:~:text=The%20legislation%20explicitly%20prohibits%20companies,respect%20of%20their%20environmental%20commitments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Union</a>, the <a href="https://www.novata.com/resources/blog/regulatory-update-uk-sdr-anti-greenwashing-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://competition-bureau.canada.ca/en/how-we-foster-competition/education-and-outreach/environmental-claims-and-greenwashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> and <a href="https://www.steptoe.com/a/web/195909/NavigatingFTCGuidance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five U.S. states</a>.</p>



<p><br><strong>Effective solutions for plastics</strong></p>



<p><br>Companies use mass balance recycled content claims, in part, because <a href="https://repurpose.global/blog/post/consumers-are-driving-action-on-plastic-waste#:~:text=Ocean%20pollution%20is%20the%20most%20pressing%20environmental%20issue%20for%20younger%20generations.&amp;text=Around%204%20in%205%20(83,if%20they%20don&#039;t%20recycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumers increasingly</a> are concerned about plastic. <a href="https://www.surfrider.org/initiatives/plastic-pollution#:~:text=An%20estimated%2011%20million%20tons,currently%20doubling%20every%20six%20years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plastic pollution has been doubling</a> every six years in our world’s oceans, where it kills thousands of marine animals every year. Scientists have also linked plastic to human health problems.</p>



<p><br>Amcor has taken some action to reduce risks from its large plastic footprint. It offers paper-based alternatives to plastic in its <a href="https://www.amcor.com/products/materials/paper-packaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amfiber</a> product line and discloses how much plastic it uses. Unlike many peers, Amcor also participates in the <a href="https://www.businessforplasticstreaty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty</a>, an industry group that publicly supports the development of an ambitious, legally binding plastics treaty.</p>



<p><br>“We encourage Amcor to expand on effective solutions that meaningfully address risks associated with its plastic footprint,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “It’s good for business and good for the planet.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, June 11, 2025 </strong>– Columbia Sportswear’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century<em>° </em>shareholder proposal requesting that the company set climate emissions reduction targets. The proposal received 7.9% of votes cast.</p>



<p>“Columbia would better serve its investors and bottom line by cutting its climate impact, like so many of its peers have done,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Climate action is a priority for many of Columbia’s outdoorsy customers, so it should be a priority for Columbia.”</p>



<p><a></a>In 2020, the owner of several active lifestyle brands <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/309/columbia-sportswear-company-releases-2020-corporate?ef_id=2efa76054317110b878d1542bfa78f26%3AG%3As" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to cut the climate footprint</a> of its manufacturing by 30%, but the company quietly stopped reporting on its commitment in 2022. Columbia has not indicated that it will adopt a new goal to keep up with the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">649 </a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footwear and apparel companies</a> that have agreed to or already set science-based emissions reduction targets as of May 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Columbia falls behind its mission and peers</strong></p>



<p><a></a>Without action, the footwear and apparel industry by 2050 could account for <a href="https://content.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/m/7f818b40f06e1afd/original/Summary-of-findings-A-New-Textiles-Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a quarter</a> of the global climate emissions necessary to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/2024-was-warmest-year-modern-record-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 was the warmest year</a> on record and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/when-risks-become-reality-extreme-weather-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists say</a> climate change added 41 days of dangerous heat and worsened the severity of flooding.</p>



<p>Consumer concern about climate change is rising with the temperature. A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PricewaterhouseCoopers survey</a> found that more than 80% of consumers say they are willing to pay more for sustainably produced goods, and some would be willing to pay 9.7% more for goods that meet environmental standards. Nine out of ten Gen Zers born between 1996 and 2010 believe that companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-gen-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey study</a>.</p>



<p>Columbia’s mission is to “unlock the outdoors for everyone.” Nevertheless, while Columbia stays silent on climate commitments, its competitors &#8212; including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia,</a> <a href="https://www.vfc.com/responsibility/planet/climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VF Corp</a>*, and <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/meet-brooks/running-responsibly/climate-action/?srsltid=AfmBOoqMK8jgLJzsGhpwmQ2R1kjF11jnwNMHvdGvMjxHHUFWqxm91UWJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooks</a> &#8212; have set climate emissions reduction goals that demonstrate they are working to protect the environment their customers value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Columbia <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/372/columbia-sportswear-company-reports-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=our%20conference%20call.-,ACCELERATE%20Growth%20Strategy,as%20enhanced%20ways%20of%20working." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to attract</a> young, active consumers, yet it has backtracked on its ambition to protect the very outdoors they want to experience,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The company could boost its reputation and competitive edge if it took further steps to protect Earth, not just use it in its advertising.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, June 6, 2025 – 13.9% of General Motors Company* (GM) shareholders voted Tuesday in support of Green Century’s° resolution asking the company to reduce climate emissions from its supply [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					
<p><strong>Boston, June 6, 2025 –</strong> 13.9% of General Motors Company* (GM) shareholders voted Tuesday in support of Green Century’s° resolution asking the company to reduce climate emissions from its supply chain. GM&#8217;s supply chain, which includes steel, aluminum and batteries, <a href="https://www.gm.com/content/dam/company/docs/us/en/gmcom/company/GM_2023_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represents 16%</a> of the company’s impact on climate change.</p>



<p>“Investors want to know how General Motors is addressing the climate impact of its supply chain,” <strong>said Green Century Funds president </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “Without a roadmap to cut these emissions, it’s unclear to investors how GM plans to mitigate climate-related risks in line with its zero emissions ambition.”</p>



<p><strong>Steel and aluminum are major climate polluters</strong></p>



<p>The climate impact of GM&#8217;s supply chain mainly comes from materials such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629622000706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steel</a> and <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/decarbonizing-aluminum-rolling-out-more-sustainable-sector" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aluminum</a>, the production of which is responsible for approximately 10% of global climate emissions. The auto industry is the second-largest consumer of steel, procuring <a href="https://theicct.org/publication/green-steel-automakers-us-europe-sep-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12%</a> of global supply, and is the largest aluminum buyer in the <a href="https://leadthecharge.org/the-problem/aluminum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world</a>. Alternatives such as <a href="https://theicct.org/publication/technologies-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-automotive-steel-US-EU-jul24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-carbon steel</a> and <a href="https://international-aluminium.org/landing/as-well-as-aluminium-recycling-saving-95-of-the-energy-needed-for-primary-aluminium-production-the-recycling-process-saves-a-similar-percentage-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycled aluminum</a> can reduce climate emissions from each material by over 95%.</p>



<p><strong>GM aims for zero emissions, but lacks a plan for its supply chain</strong></p>



<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/climate-transition-planning#what" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate transition plan</a> should describe the strategies, milestones, and timelines for a company to deliver on its decarbonization targets. It also includes progress reporting. Green Century’s proposal argued that these steps are as necessary for GM&#8217;s supply chain as they are for its other emissions sources.</p>



<p>To achieve zero emissions, GM will need to significantly scale up procurement of low-emissions steel and aluminum from its <a href="https://www.gm.com/content/dam/company/docs/us/en/gmcom/company/GM_2023_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current target</a> of 10% by 2030, among other steps. And while GM has outlined detailed climate emissions reduction efforts for its operations and vehicle use, it hasn’t disclosed similar targets or plans for its supply chain.</p>



<p>GM has taken some steps to cut supply chain emissions, including target-setting requirements for its <a href="https://www.gm.com/content/dam/company/docs/us/en/gmcom/company/GM_2023_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suppliers</a>. However, the largest U.S. auto maker has yet to report on results or incorporate existing steps into a supply chain emissions reduction plan that charts a path to zero emissions.</p>



<p><strong>Competitors are doing more to reduce supply chain emissions</strong></p>



<p>Competitors such as <a href="https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/publications/more/group-sustainability-report-2023-2674" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volkswagen</a> and <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup_com/ir/downloads/en/2025/bericht/BMW-Group-Report-2024-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMW</a> disclose supply chain climate emissions reduction targets and plans, and additional companies including <a href="https://stegra.com/news-and-stories/mercedes-benz-and-h2-green-steel-announce-agreements-in-both-europe-and-north-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a>, <a href="https://stegra.com/news-and-stories/h2-green-steel-collaborates-with-volvo-group-for-supply-of-near-zero-emissions-steel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volvo</a> and <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2023/sustainability/porsche-co2-reduced-steel-in-sports-cars-34225.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Porsche</a> have locked in supplies of more sustainable steel. GM&#8217;s lack of a plan to fully mitigate its contribution to climate change may harm its image and credibility so as to become a factor in customer purchasing decisions, particularly in Europe.</p>



<p>“It’s time for GM to apply the same rigor to cutting supply chain emissions that it musters for its other business goals,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century.</strong> “Investors expect nothing less from a company that aims to lead the automotive industry in creating a world with zero emissions.”</p>

<p>Boston, June 5, 2025 – 5.8% of Walmart* shareholder votes were cast in favor of a Green Century° proposal urging the company to assess how it can increase the scale, pace and rigor of its sustainable packaging efforts. In part, the proposal urged Walmart to reduce its plastic packaging and ensure its recycling labels don’t mislead consumers.</p>



<p><br>“Plastic pollution is harming our oceans, our wildlife and our health,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>.. “Walmart’s investors have sent a message that the company cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution problem. It’s a material risk that concerns investors.”</p>



<p><br>The UN Environment Programme estimates that the social and environmental <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/42277/Plastic_pollution.pdf?sequence=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs of plastic pollution</a> are between $300 and 600 billion dollars per year. This includes costs to human health, the costs of ocean clean-ups and lost marine ecosystem services such as food production and recreation. Although recycling has often been elevated as the solution to global plastic pollution, experts agree it is reducing plastic use that is key.</p>



<p><br>Walmart set a <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/purpose/esgreport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal to reduce its use of virgin plastic</a> in its private brand packaging by 15% by 2025 from 2020 levels, but as of 2023, its use of virgin plastic for private brand packaging had increased by 6%.</p>



<p><br>Studies show that consumers increasingly want to be offered products in reusable packaging, and that reusable packaging is one of the most <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/tipping-point-year-for-reusable-packaging-systems/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20United%20Nations,into%20the%20environment%20by%202040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective ways to reduce plastic pollution</a>. However, Walmart does not disclose information about reusable packaging initiatives in its <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/purpose/esgreport/environmental/waste-circular-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainability report</a>.</p>



<p><br>Beyond failing to disclose effective strategies to reduce its use of plastic packaging, Walmart uses labels with misleading recyclability claims on its plastic packaging, including the “Store Drop Off” label. According to investigations conducted by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-09-29/us-store-drop-off-plastic-recycling-often-ends-up-in-landfills?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/abcnews.go.com/US/put-dozens-trackers-plastic-bags-recycling-trashed/story?id=99509422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC</a>, the majority of plastic bags and films deposited in “Store Drop Off bins” are sent to landfills or incinerated, not recycled. As a result, some major brands such as <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/esg-topics/recyclability-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mondelez</a> have publicly committed to stop using the “Store Drop Off” label while <a href="https://grist.org/accountability/amazon-says-its-plastic-packaging-can-be-recycled-an-investigation-finds-it-usually-isnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other brands</a> have quietly stopped using it.</p>



<p><br>“Without action from companies such as Walmart, the impacts of plastic on our environment and the risks to human health will only increase,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “Investors understand this and have sent a clear message to Walmart: It is time to stop messing around with labels and reduce plastic pollution.”</p>
