										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 was a big year for Green Century. Thank you, the investors in the Green Century Funds, for your commitment to align your investments with your values, your steadfast support during a challenging market, and your dedication to making a positive impact in our world. We work with companies to secure improved environmental policies and practices to help them mitigate their material risks and create real world impact for our investors. We use honed strategies, deep engagements, and high volume – this fall alone, we have met with dozens of companies and filed 28 shareholder proposals – to produce results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are our top 10 highlights:</span></p>
<p><b>10. Leading in green bond investments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Green bonds are issued by companies, governments, and supranational institutions to help finance environmental and climate change mitigation projects around the world. The </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/balanced-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century Balanced Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purchased its first green bond</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_24137" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24137" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-24137 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-300x199-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-24137" class="wp-caption-text">A green bond in the Green Century Balanced Fund supports El Salvador’s Bósforo solar project.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2008 and the percentage in the fixed income portion of the Balanced Fund has risen from 15% in 2013 to </span><b>64% in 2022.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While the marketing of green bonds is expanding, not all “green” bonds fund projects with measurable environmental benefits. Green Century has a high standard for inclusion and all of the bonds have earned the Green Bond label. A current green bond is financing the construction of 10 solar power plants in rural, low-income areas of El Salvador, which will help meet growing energy demand and reduce El Salvador’s dependence on imported fuel.</span></p>
<p><b>9. Clarifying Environmentally Responsible Options for Investors.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Earlier this month, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the US SIF Foundation released their biannual “Trends” report that showed that “ESG” investments &#8211; investments integrating environmental, social and governance data &#8211; totaled $8.4 trillion in 2022, compared to $17.1 trillion in 2020. What at first looks like a significant decline in interest is likely a result of a changed methodology and some big firms from counting their assets as ESG assets this time. The findings serve as a reminder that in the last five years, many new firms with a variety of investment strategies have entered the field, which has left investors to sort through the marketing claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century believes the proposed rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prevent misleading or deceptive fund names and requiring more detailed ESG disclosure by funds will help protect investors from those who may wish to take advantage of investor interest in sustainable investing. The Green Century Funds </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GCCM-Prospectus-11.28.22.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prospectus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> details our approach and we have spoken about the differences between using ESG ratings and integration, values-based screens and creating impact through advocacy extensively in the last year.  Comments from recent media interviews are featured in these </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-17/-hating-esg-advocates-rethink-label-as-us-culture-wars-bite?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  and </span><a href="https://www.reutersevents.com/sustainability/esg-investment-worlds-troubled-teen-forced-grow" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> articles. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>8. Protecting the Arctic National Wilderness Refuge.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our award-winning shareholder advocacy program capped off the spring season with a </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/chevron-exits-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-after-green-century-shareholder-proposals-opposing-arctic-drilling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win at Chevron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.* The company has abandoned plans to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and has ended its involvement in<img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-14546 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/screenshot-miro.medium.com-2022.12.22-09_40_52-300x213.png" alt="" width="300" height="213" /> the Arctic region following two successive shareholder proposals from the Green Century Funds. While Chevron publicly rebuffed Green Century’s initial proposal calling on the company to renounce Arctic drilling in December 2020, it quietly went about the expensive process of exiting its Arctic leases. The news of Chevron’s Arctic exit became public at the end of May. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency say that expanding coal, oil and gas supply will cause the Earth to warm beyond 1.5 degrees Celsuis &#8211; the limit to avert the worst impacts of climate change. To stop new fossil fuel projects, Green Century led unprecedented shareholder action to hold Chubb,* The Hartford,* and Travelers accountable, and Marketwatch reported on our advocacy in its </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/influential-fund-manager-green-century-tells-big-insurers-to-drop-big-oil-11645049047" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influential Fund Manager Tells Big Insurers to Drop Big Oil</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article.</span></p>
<p><b>7. Moving Beyond Plastic with our non-profit owners. </b>Green Century’s unique ownership by non-profits means that 100% of the net proceeds earned on managing the Green Century Funds belongs to the environmental and public health groups, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/about-us/">nine Public Interest Research Groups,</a> that founded us. In California, one of our owners, CALPIRG, <a href="https://pirg.org/updates/volunteers-organizers-leaders-celebrate-californias-landmark-plastic-reduction-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated the passage of the Plastic Pollution Producer Responsibility Act</a> in October. The new law requires companies to reduce the amount of plastic they use in their products, specifically mandating a 25% reduction in plastic packaging and foodware. The law additionally requires that all single-use food packaging be recyclable, so less ends up in landfills and the environment. As our owners pass state legislation to reduce plastic, the Green Century staff has successfully negotiated plastic reduction <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/?s=coca-cola">agreements with Coca-Cola</a>* and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/">Mattel</a>,* and kicked off the 2022-23 shareholder season by securing a majority vote on plastic reduction at <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/general-mills-shareholders-call-for-less-plastic-packaging-over-55-of-voting-shareholders-opt-for-green-century-proposal/">General Mills</a>*, which was the first majority vote on an environmental proposal this fall.</p>
<p><b>6. Receiving a Climate Change Leadership Award</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Pulitzer Prize-winning news organization selected the Green Century Funds President (me!) as one of the 30 honorees </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in its </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-action-30-top-global-leaders-working-toward-climate-solutions-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate Action 30 list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Announced to coincide with Climate Week in NYC this fall, the group of</span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-14548 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture2-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 includes global leaders from multiple sectors. I am very proud of how the Green Century Funds offer individuals, small businesses and organizations the opportunity to invest fossil fuel free and push companies to curb climate change so we move off of fossil fuels to a clean energy economy. </span></p>
<p><b>5. Challenging McDonald’s board…and spurring companies to act on factory farming</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>I was nominated to McDonald’s board of directors by Carl Icahn, one of the first “activist investors”,  to highlight the company’s broken<img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-14545 alignright" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pig-300x282.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="282" /> promise to end the use of gestation crates for pregnant sows. While McDonald’s has yet to live up to its initial commitment, the board campaign received widespread media coverage and the U.S. Humane Society has credited this visibility and pressure in moving CVS* and Walgreens* to accelerate their transitions to cage-free eggs and pushing General Mills* and Denny’s* to move towards elimination of gestation crates in their pork supply chains.</p>
<p><b>4. Protecting Forests and Biodiversity with one of the world&#8217;s largest home improvement retailers.</b> In March, Lowe’s agreed to accelerate its efforts to eliminate deforestation and the logging of old growth forests in its supply chains. Roughly 90% of Lowe&#8217;s wood comes from North America, including from Canada’s boreal forest, which constitutes 25% of the world’s remaining intact forest and is home to a rich variety of wildlife including the gray wolf. Canada’s boreal forest stores twice as much carbon per hectare as tropical forests, which was a key reason Green Century expanded our work in this region.</p>
<p><b>3. Banned and proud of it.</b> In August, Texas banned <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/">Green Century Funds</a>, along with 345 investment funds, from being used by state and some local entities because they don&#8217;t invest in the oil and gas industry. As one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds, Green Century has been an outspoken supporter of the global fossil fuel divestment campaign and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Divest-Invest-Movement-2-Pager-9.30.22.pdf">its success</a>. Mainstream asset managers such as Blackrock, which has <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to portray itself</a> as a sustainability leader, have gone to great lengths to now publicize how <i>much ($170 billion dollars)</i> they invest in these dirty industries in an effort to be removed from these lists in Texas, Louisiana and Florida. While I believe Blackrock is playing both sides of the field, the Green Century Funds are focused on reducing our reliance on dirty energy and are proud to be one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds. This year, we launched a campaign to convince insurance companies to stop underwriting new fossil fuel projects that was featured in Marketwatch’s article <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/influential-fund-manager-green-century-tells-big-insurers-to-drop-big-oil-11645049047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influential Fund Manager Green Century Tells Big Insurers to Drop Big Oil.</a></p>
<p><b>2. Pushing Costco to set greenhouse gas emissions targets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2021, Costco* refused to set climate emissions reduction targets when Green Century staff engaged with the company. After 70% of its voting shareholders supported the </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/equity-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century Equity Fund’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subsequent proposal on this issue and we held follow-up discussions with the company, Costco has now committed to setting carbon pollution reductions. This win is important because Costco was one of only three of the 50 largest S&amp;P companies without a major climate commitment last December and because it will set emissions reductions across its full supply chain &#8211; called “scope 3”emissions &#8211; which is the source of the majority of its emissions.</span></p>
<p><b>1. Having the support of investors like you. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our number one highlight of 2022 is the support of investors in </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Green Century Funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be wondering about the difference between a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/ira-information/">traditional IRA vs. a Roth IRA</a>. The distinction involves the way each investment is taxed. In the case of traditional IRAs, the investor provides “pre-tax” contributions. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, involve “after-tax” contributions. But what does that actually mean for your retirement fund? What are the benefits of a traditional IRA vs a Roth IRA? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Green Century we offer a wide array of investment vehicles including both Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. Learn more about each type of investment and its benefits below.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are Traditional IRAs?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a traditional IRA (short for “individual retirement account”), investors receive immediate tax benefit for money they contribute to the account (up to certain limits). This is what we mean when we say traditional IRAs allow for “pre-tax” contributions. The money that flows into traditional IRAs is not subject to taxation at the time it is invested or earned. Instead, you pay tax on the amounts you withdraw from the account at a later date, usually in/for retirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of traditional IRAs accrue from the deferral of taxes. In other words, money that would otherwise go to the government in the form of tax payments up front is instead invested and earns a return. While you do have to pay tax at a later date, your money grows in the meantime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IRA&#8217;s may work well for people who currently find themselves subject to high marginal tax rates: high earners with money left over to save and invest. The immediate tax break can offset what would otherwise be significant taxation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should be aware that there are required minimum distributions you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> take that begin at age 72. Also, traditional IRAs are subject to maximum contribution amounts that differ depending on your age. If you’re under the age of 50, the maximum annual contribution is currently $7,000, while those over 50 may contribute up to $8,000 per year.</span></p>
<h3><b>What are Roth IRA Accounts?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Roth IRA, investors contribute “after-tax” money to the investment vehicle. In other words, you don’t get an immediate tax deduction or credit for the money you contribute to a Roth IRA. Instead, the benefit of a Roth IRA is that any investment gains in your Roth IRA can be withdrawn at a later date, tax-free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roth IRAs are especially useful if you expect your marginal tax rate to be significantly higher at the time you withdraw your investment compared to the time you make your initial contributions. For example, this would be true of people who expect to earn more later in their careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for your withdrawals to be tax-free, the account must have been open for a minimum of 5 years at the time of your first withdrawal. Additionally, you must be at least 59.5 years old when you make your first withdrawal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also know that there are income limits for those seeking to make use of a Roth IRA. Individuals earning more than $144,000 in the year 2022 &#8211; or married couples earning more than $214,000 annually &#8211; may not contribute to a Roth IRA.</span></p>
<h3><b>Open a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA with Green Century</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no single right answer for people trying to decide between a </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/ira-information/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditional IRA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vs. a </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/ira-information/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roth IRA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each investment vehicle involves a trade-off between pros and cons, as well as immediate and deferred benefits and costs. We strongly suggest you obtain professional advice that takes into account your goals, investment time horizon, and financial situation before deciding in favor of one or the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re able to answer any questions you may have about the types of accounts we offer at Green Century.
