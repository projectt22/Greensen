										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This month has been dubbed <a href="https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plastic Free July</a> and you may have read articles this year about people trying to live <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/26/nx-s1-5021546/plastic-free-sustainable-living-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/12/my-no-plastic-life-i-tried-to-cut-out-single-use-items-for-a-month-and-it-almost-broke-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic</a> for a week – and finding out that it’s all but impossible. Single-use plastics are everywhere. Why is that a problem and what can be done about it?<br></p>



<p><strong>1. What is the problem with plastic?</strong></p>



<p><br>Plastic pollution is everywhere, from the 36,000-foot-deep <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plastic-bag-found-bottom-worlds-deepest-ocean-trench/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mariana Trench</a>&nbsp; to the peak of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount Everest</a>. And plastic is not just polluting places, it’s polluting the bodies of animals too, including humans. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/climate/seabirds-plastic-contamination-crunchy-australia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">778 pieces of plastic were found in the body of one seabird</a>.</p>



<p>Microplastics are now found throughout the human body and levels are especially concentrated in the brain. Adding to the concern, recent studies have found that <a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-human-brains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accumulation of plastic in the brain</a> is growing in parallel with plastic waste in the environment, while according to the Pew Charitable Trust, if business as usual continues, plastic flows into oceans will <a href="https://www.pew.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triple by 2040</a>.</p>



<p><br><strong>2. What is the solution?</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Reduce!</strong> Step one: we need to use WAY less single-use plastic. We can do this by eliminating unnecessary plastic or substituting it for less harmful material like fiber.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reuse! </strong>Reusable packaging can either be made of plastic or other materials. In this case, instead of using the packaging once, it can be used, sanitized, and used again. Think Coca-Cola bottles. In many countries, including parts of Europe and South America, Coca-Cola sells its products in bottles that are used again and again, instead of using a bottle once and throwing it out. Refillable glass bottles can be <a href="https://upstreamsolutions.org/blog/nre-bottle-refill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reused about 50 times</a>!</p>



<p><br><strong>Recycle! </strong>Although most plastics are not widely recycled, recycling also plays a role in reducing plastic use. Companies are reducing their use of virgin plastic by using more recycled plastic.</p>



<p><br><strong>3. Can’t we just recycle our way out of this problem?</strong></p>



<p><br>No. While paper and metals are highly recyclable materials that can be recycled over and over again, it is harder to recycle plastic and as a result the recycling rate for plastic is only about <a href="https://stories.undp.org/why-arent-we-recycling-more-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9%</a>. Additionally, recycling plastic actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/recycled-plastic-more-toxic-no-fix-pollution-greenpeace-warns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases health risks</a> by exposing local communities to toxic air emissions and increasing the toxicity of the plastic itself.</p>



<p><br><strong>4. So, what can you do?</strong></p>



<p>The good news is that there is a LOT we can do to reduce our use of plastic to protect the planet and our health. Here are some things individuals can do:</p>



<ul>
<li>Choose products that have less or no plastic packaging</li>



<li>Buy “used” rather than “new” when you can – whether it’s thrifting (yes, clothes contain plastic!) or toys for your kids, keeping new material out of the waste stream drives down demand for new plastic.</li>



<li>Tell the stores you shop at that you want to buy products without plastic packaging or that have reusable or refillable packaging.</li>



<li><a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/resources/how-young-environmentalists-can-help-tackle-the-plastic-pollution-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kids can protect the environment from plastic too</a>!</li>



<li>Urge your representatives to support effective legislation to cut plastic, including:<ul><li><a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/extended-producer-responsibility/epr-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extended producer responsibility</a> (EPR) laws, which make companies pay for the plastic waste they create;</li></ul><ul><li>Bottle bills, which pay customers to bring back bottles and have been shown to increase recycling rates;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Plastics bag bans, which have also been found to significantly <a href="https://grist.org/science/plastic-bag-ban-beach-cleanups-ocean-conservancy-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce the amount of plastic bags found in the environment</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><br>And if you’re a corporation that uses plastic, you can: reduce, reuse, recycle – in that order!</p>



<ul>
<li>First, make sure that you are only using essential plastic packaging.</li>



<li>Then, offer products in reusable packaging where appropriate.</li>



<li>Finally, for cases where you cannot eliminate or reuse the packaging, use packaging that is made from recycled plastic material.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br>What is Green Century doing about plastics?</strong></p>



<p>As the manager of the Green Century Funds, Green Century Capital Management engages companies with large plastic footprints to press them to reduce their use of plastic. For example, Green Century convinced hotel chains Marriott, Hilton, and Choice Hotels to <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/why-are-big-brands-reducing-plastic/">reduce their use of single use plastics</a>. Because most plastic ends up in landfills and incinerators, we also engage with companies to make sure their recyclability claims don’t mislead consumers. For example, we got Starbucks to commit to ensure that its plastic <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/starbucks-to-expand-disclosure-on-reuse-assess-plastic-recyclability-labels/">recyclability labels</a> are accurate.</p>



<p><br><strong>Is this problem going to get solved?</strong></p>



<p><br>It is not all doom and gloom. A UNEP report found that we can <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/42277/Plastic_pollution.pdf?sequence=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce global plastic pollution by 80%</a> by 2040 – but collective action is key. 175 nations will meet in Geneva, Switzerland in August 2025 to negotiate a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02064-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global plastics treaty</a>. Our elected representatives in states across the country can and have passed laws that reduce plastic. Companies can act quickly on this, at the urging of investors, customers, and civil society organizations. We can turn this ship around, but we all need to get rowing in the same direction. Green Century will continue to push companies to cut plastic and build a truly circular economy on the one planet we’ve got.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We’re excited to share that our award-winning Green Century° team achieved 11 new environmental policy victories during the 2024-2025 shareholder season to protect forests, reduce climate change pollution, cut single-use plastics and more. We also saw 18 policies implemented that companies had previously committed to adopting this year – thanks to our advocacy.</p>



<p>Below are our Top Ten Highlights from the 2025 Shareholder Advocacy Season.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="518" height="345" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26810" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy.jpeg 518w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" /></figure>



<p>10. Preserving Forests: J.M. Smucker*, parent company of Folgers and Dunkin’ at Home coffee products, agreed to review its forest protection policies with an ambition of eventually sourcing all of its ingredients without causing any deforestation. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, which requested that the company ensure its supplies of coffee, palm, soy and cocoa, as well as wood pulp used for its packaging, are deforestation free. The company plans to follow the assessment with a transition to deforestation-free supplies in 2026.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="551" height="367" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26807" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1.jpeg 551w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px" /></figure>



<p>9. Safeguarding Animal Welfare: Green Century filed a shareholder proposal asking Darden Restaurants* to eliminate the use of gestation crates for pigs. Gestation crates are considered inhumane and enable factory farming systems that increase pollution. The resolution received a significant 20% vote in support from investors and, if adopted, would put Darden on par with companies such as Bloomin&#8217; Brands<em>, Costco</em> and Target* that are phasing out gestation crates in their supply chains.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="512" height="341" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26806" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3.jpeg 512w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure>



<p>8. Protecting Biodiversity: Green Century filed a shareholder resolution at Conagra* urging the packaged food company to strengthen protections for wild lands as it sources ingredients such as beef and soy. In exchange for withdrawal of our shareholder proposal, Conagra committed to assessing more protections for biodiverse ecosystems such as grasslands and savannahs affected by its global supply chain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="537" height="358" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26805" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4.jpeg 537w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></figure>



<p>7. Disclosing Climate Impact: In response to a Green Century shareholder proposal and subsequent agreement, Lowe’s Home Improvement* released climate emissions data from the products it sells. These new disclosures represent 84% of Lowe’s contribution to climate change and will show investors the categories that represent the biggest polluters, allowing stakeholders to press the company more effectively on how it plans to mitigate its climate impact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="487" height="323" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26804" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5.jpeg 487w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5-300x199.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></figure>



<p>6. Stopping Plastic Pollution: Green Century reached an agreement with Starbucks* to ensure the coffee behemoth provides accurate information about the recyclability of its plastic cups and shares details about its transition to reusable cups by early 2026. Sealed Air*<em>, the packaging company that sells BUBBLE WRAP® and air pillows, </em>and packaging company Amcor* also agreed to improve the sustainability of their packaging to ensure their recycling labels do not mislead consumers. All three commitments came after Green Century agreed to withdraw related shareholder proposals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="543" height="362" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26803" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6.jpeg 543w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></figure>



<p>5. Protecting Farm Animal Welfare: Jack in the Box* hit its benchmark to source 25% of its pork from pigs raised in “open pens” instead of gestation crates by the end of 2024. This interim target, up from 0% at the end of 2023, is an important step toward the company’s goal to source 100% of its pork that way by 2026 as outlined in an agreement with Green Century° in 2023. Gestation crates are controversial because they harm animals and can also damage a company’s reputation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="432" height="288" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26802" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7.jpeg 432w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px" /></figure>



<p>4. Reducing Single-use Plastic: Coca-Cola*, the largest soft drink company in the world, committed to disclosing its investments and successes in reusable bottle initiatives in response to a Green Century° shareholder proposal. The company also agreed to continue to disclose quantitatively the share of beverages it sells in reusable containers. These commitments will help investors track the company’s efforts to mitigate plastic-related risks and push for progress.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="630" height="420" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26801" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8.jpeg 630w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></figure>



<p>3. Protecting the Climate: Green Century filed 12 climate-related shareholder proposals this year at major companies ranging from Amazon* to McDonald&#8217;s*<em>,</em> pressing the companies to disclose their full contribution to climate change, targets to reduce it, and plans to achieve those targets. We filed one of those resolutions at TD Bank* which led to the company pledging to evaluate its plans to reduce its carbon footprint as part of a broader governance review and clarify the climate expertise on its board.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="508" height="381" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26799" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10.jpeg 508w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></figure>



<p>2. Preserving Tropical Forests: Costco*, the third largest retailer in the world, will publish a comprehensive assessment and action plan to reduce deforestation in its Kirkland Signature brand products, protecting threatened species such as the jaguar and giant otter. Costco committed to publish the plan by 2025 after dialogue and withdrawal of a related shareholder proposal by Green Century°.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="643" height="429" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-26798" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11.jpeg 643w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" /></figure>



<p>1. Conserving Nature: The Okefenokee is the largest blackwater swamp in North America and one of the largest intact freshwater ecosystems in the world. Since 2021, Green Century° has pressed chemical company Chemours* to avoid mining near the Okefenokee. Our advocacy amplified public backlash that helped push mining company Twin Pines Minerals, which had previously contracted with Chemours, to sell its Okefenokee-adjacent land to a conservation group instead. Green Century°&#8217;s related 2025 biodiversity resolution at Chemours won enough support to refile in future years and help keep mining away from the Okefenokee.</p>

<p><br><strong>Boston, March 20, 2025</strong> – Coca-Cola, the largest soft drink company in the world, has committed to disclosing its ongoing investments in reusable bottles and the outcomes of these efforts. The company took this action in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>



<p><br>Coca-Cola sells beverages in more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherfarmbrough/2019/03/15/coca-cola-reveals-it-produces-3m-tonnes-of-plastic-packaging-a-year-in-ground-breaking-report/?sh=315b871e670f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 billion plastic bottles</a> a year and is the world’s <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2024/02/07/bffp-movement-unveils-2023-global-brand-audit-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest plastic polluter</a>. However, the company recently reneged on its goals to deliver 25% of beverages in reusable containers by 2030 and to cut 3 million metric tons of new plastic by 2025.</p>



<p><br>“Though Coca-Cola regrettably abandoned its plastic reduction and reuse goals, this new commitment to disclosing reusable packaging investments and results will help investors track the company’s efforts to mitigate plastic-related risks,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>,<strong> president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “With plastic pollution <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubling every six years</a> and less than <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-much-plastic-gets-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of it</a> getting recycled, it’s clear that reuse and reduction are key.”</p>



<p><br>According to experts, one of the most effective ways to <a href="https://emf.thirdlight.com/file/24/sjZ_pROsjk8VSKPsjXVEszMGHY/Unlocking%20a%20reuse%20revolution%20-%20scaling%20returnable%20packaging.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce both plastic use and plastic pollution</a> is by replacing single-use plastic containers with reusable ones. Reusable packaging is good for business, too. Studies show that <a href="https://www.greensportsalliance.org/playbooks/reuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumers want</a> companies to give them more reusable packaging options.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reuse Disclosure Necessary to Track Coca-Cola’s Efforts to Reduce Single-Use Plastic</strong></p>



<p><br>When Coca-Cola dropped its reuse goal in late 2024, the beverage giant stated that it plans to expand its use of reusable packaging in markets where existing infrastructure can support this important part of its portfolio. Coca-Cola reported that 14% of its beverages were sold in reusable containers <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/content/dam/company/us/en/reports/2023-environmental-update/2023-environmental-update.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in both 2022 and 2023</a>, but that the share of Coca-Cola beverages sold in reusable glass bottles <a href="https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1128/coca-cola-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased in 2024</a>.</p>



<p><br>“We will be monitoring Coca-Cola’s disclosure on how it is investing in reusables and how this translates into more beverages sold in reusable packaging,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a>, <strong>shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “At the end of the day, investors need these disclosures to ensure Coca-Cola is mitigating the regulatory, reputational and systemic risks posed by its role in the plastic pollution crisis.”</p>



<p><br>Plastic production is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/plastic-consumption-course-nearly-double-by-2050-research-2023-02-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on pace to double by 2050</a> without meaningful action to reduce it &#8211; and companies like Coca-Cola can make an outsized impact. Already, the equivalent of <a href="https://www.unep.org/plastic-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic</a> end up in our oceans, rivers and lakes every day. Studies show that microplastics are <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/02/how-microplastics-get-into-the-food-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polluting the human body</a>, too, and have been linked to serious health impacts.</p>

<p><strong>BOSTON, October 16, 2024</strong> – In response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century<em>°</em>, Costco Wholesale Corporation* committed to publishing a comprehensive deforestation assessment and action plan for its Kirkland Signature brand. In exchange, Green Century and co-filer Boston Common Asset Management agreed to withdraw the proposal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nature-related risks have emerged as a high priority issue for investors in the last year and we applaud Costco for strengthening its efforts to protect vital habitats around the world, <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Millions of Costco members will be gratified to know that their favorite Kirkland Signature items may be moving towards protecting rather than harming tropical forests, home to species from jaguars to giant otters.”</p>



<p>Costco says it plans to release its deforestation assessment and action plan by the end of 2025. The disclosure will lay out Costco’s roadmap to protect forests and other natural landscapes from deforestation when sourcing its beef, palm oil, soy and wood products. Those industries combined drive nearly three-quarters of tropical <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/drivers-of-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Costco to consider first-ever ‘no-deforestation’ targets</strong></p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/dining/costco.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly one-third</a> of U.S. consumers shop at Costco, making it the third-largest retailer in the world behind Amazon and Walmart. Kirkland-brand items generated <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-built-56-billion-kirkland-120000770.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADPkNhgRSwQj1r5dDPyAw8P3vBeCsB_YPGKih1keNcrKIBb5hbzW-oByMFBSsRutYAs9SZw6_c7_yFljzYHttINMKR7CpPyozBe04lFUYxpkpSBH8c4ASdbsEhkhHu0vNyimz1CJjpoq2VFIzt7BwZFeuT68TetxpF2VK5i8TF6f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$56 billion</a> in revenue for Costco last fiscal year – more than Nike, Coca-Cola, and United Airlines. The brand’s massive footprint means any incremental commitment to protect the planet has an outsized effect.</p>



<p>Many countries <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/policies-tackling-deforestation-pose-investor-risk-report-says-2024-03-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented new policies</a> last year to preserve forests, promote biodiversity and help the climate. While Costco did not commit to fully eliminating deforestation from its Kirkland Signature brand supply chains, the wholesaler stated that it will consider adopting time-bound deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) commitments for beef, soy, palm oil and/or wood products in its forthcoming deforestation action plan.</p>



<p>“Costco knows it shouldn’t destroy tropical forests to stock its shelves,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, Director of Shareholder Advocacy at Green Century</strong>. “We appreciate this step and encourage the company to further protect global forests by setting time-bound no-deforestation targets across its supply chain.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A popular term in the investment industry right now is shareholder advocacy, but what is considered shareholder advocacy and why has it become such a hot button topic? Shareholder advocacy [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular term in the investment industry right now is shareholder advocacy, but what is considered shareholder advocacy and why has it become such a hot button topic? Shareholder advocacy is a tool that is used by investors to push a company to report on or change a policy, usually around environmental, social or governance issues. Shareholder advocacy takes the form of discussions, shareholder resolutions, proxy votes and other actions. These are very effective ways to drive change toward sustainability for a company or an industry. Shareholder advocacy can also push laggard companies that need to be held accountable for failing to address risks and push them to catch up to peer companies. Shareholder advocacy for Green Century Funds centers on environmental issues. </span></p>
<h3>What is Shareholder Advocacy?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shareholder advocates assess the reputational, competitive, regulatory, and legal risks that a company faces and brings these issues to the attention of corporate management. Shareholder advocates lead dialogues with company executives to learn how the company is addressing an issue. If needed, shareholder advocates press for changes through negotiations or by filing a shareholder resolution. For example, Green Century shareholder advocates learned that Costco* did not have any greenhouse gas emissions goals to address the company’s potential climate risk and larger role in the world.  Our shareholder advocates held  several meetings, filed a shareholder advocacy proposal and won a majority vote on the issue. The upshot is Green Century advocates were successful in getting </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-green-century-shareholder-proposal-prompts-costco-commitment-to-set-new-climate-emissions-reduction-targets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Costco* to adopt greenhouse gas emission goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Green Century advocates push for action on today’s most pressing environmental issues, including plastic pollution, animal welfare, reducing carbon emissions and sourcing renewable energy. For us, shareholder advocacy means helping a company reduce its’ material risks while securing changes that improve our air, water, and land. </span></p>
<h3>Who Can Be a Shareholder Advocate?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly who can be a shareholder advocate? Typically, a shareholder advocate is an individual or group of investors who try to influence corporate management. An individual who owns stock in a company, provided they meet certain requirements, can engage with a company. More commonly, shareholder advocates work for an asset manager such as a mutual fund or asset owner such as a state pension fund. </span></p>
<h3>Why is Shareholder Advocacy Important?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shareholder advocacy is a very effective way for investors to help change corporate policy concerning environmental or social corporate policies. As investors increasingly become interested in sustainable investing, they want to know if their mutual funds and asset managers have a shareholder engagement or shareholder advocacy program with strong  track records.  If the shareholder advocacy program is effective, investors see how they can align their values with making a positive impact in the world.  </span></p>

					<p><b>Media Contacts: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Boston, April 18, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keurig Dr. Pepper*, a leading global beverage company with brands from Snapple to 7Up, will boost efforts to cut single-use plastic by expanding its “reuse and refill” options across the country. In exchange for its heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction in total plastic packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of plastic flowing into our oceans is on pace to </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20plastic%20trash,to%2029%20million%20metric%20tons." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly triple by 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Keurig Dr. Pepper for stepping up its efforts to address the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keurig Dr. Pepper’s planned actions include expanding its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to include more details on refillable and reusable container pilots. Starting in 2023, the company pledged to publish an annual “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its CSR report. By 2024, the company plans to launch new reuse and refill pilots in key U.S. markets where the local infrastructure and culture are conducive to their success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Keurig Dr. Pepper help build a circular economy by providing more reuse options – from soda cups to K-Cup Pods – in communities across the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Replacing Single-Use Plastics Effectively</b></span><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuse and refill models are </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the most effective ways</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to replace single-use plastics.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Companies such as Keurig Dr. Pepper are beginning to realize that an investment in reusable and refillable containers can mitigate the financial, regulatory, and reputational risks posed by single-use plastics,” added Sanders. “They’re also seeing consumers act, in growing numbers, on the common-sense conviction that nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our planet for hundreds of years.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[2022 was a big year for Green Century. Thank you, the investors in the Green Century Funds, for your commitment to align your investments with your values, your steadfast support [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 was a big year for Green Century. Thank you, the investors in the Green Century Funds, for your commitment to align your investments with your values, your steadfast support during a challenging market, and your dedication to making a positive impact in our world. We work with companies to secure improved environmental policies and practices to help them mitigate their material risks and create real world impact for our investors. We use honed strategies, deep engagements, and high volume – this fall alone, we have met with dozens of companies and filed 28 shareholder proposals – to produce results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are our top 10 highlights:</span></p>
<p><b>10. Leading in green bond investments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Green bonds are issued by companies, governments, and supranational institutions to help finance environmental and climate change mitigation projects around the world. The </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/balanced-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century Balanced Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> purchased its first green bond</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_24137" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24137" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-24137 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-300x199-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-24137" class="wp-caption-text">A green bond in the Green Century Balanced Fund supports El Salvador’s Bósforo solar project.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2008 and the percentage in the fixed income portion of the Balanced Fund has risen from 15% in 2013 to </span><b>64% in 2022.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While the marketing of green bonds is expanding, not all “green” bonds fund projects with measurable environmental benefits. Green Century has a high standard for inclusion and all of the bonds have earned the Green Bond label. A current green bond is financing the construction of 10 solar power plants in rural, low-income areas of El Salvador, which will help meet growing energy demand and reduce El Salvador’s dependence on imported fuel.</span></p>
<p><b>9. Clarifying Environmentally Responsible Options for Investors.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Earlier this month, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the US SIF Foundation released their biannual “Trends” report that showed that “ESG” investments &#8211; investments integrating environmental, social and governance data &#8211; totaled $8.4 trillion in 2022, compared to $17.1 trillion in 2020. What at first looks like a significant decline in interest is likely a result of a changed methodology and some big firms from counting their assets as ESG assets this time. The findings serve as a reminder that in the last five years, many new firms with a variety of investment strategies have entered the field, which has left investors to sort through the marketing claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century believes the proposed rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prevent misleading or deceptive fund names and requiring more detailed ESG disclosure by funds will help protect investors from those who may wish to take advantage of investor interest in sustainable investing. The Green Century Funds </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GCCM-Prospectus-11.28.22.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prospectus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> details our approach and we have spoken about the differences between using ESG ratings and integration, values-based screens and creating impact through advocacy extensively in the last year.  Comments from recent media interviews are featured in these </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-17/-hating-esg-advocates-rethink-label-as-us-culture-wars-bite?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  and </span><a href="https://www.reutersevents.com/sustainability/esg-investment-worlds-troubled-teen-forced-grow" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> articles. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>8. Protecting the Arctic National Wilderness Refuge.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our award-winning shareholder advocacy program capped off the spring season with a </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/chevron-exits-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-after-green-century-shareholder-proposals-opposing-arctic-drilling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win at Chevron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.* The company has abandoned plans to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and has ended its involvement in<img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-14546 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/screenshot-miro.medium.com-2022.12.22-09_40_52-300x213.png" alt="" width="300" height="213" /> the Arctic region following two successive shareholder proposals from the Green Century Funds. While Chevron publicly rebuffed Green Century’s initial proposal calling on the company to renounce Arctic drilling in December 2020, it quietly went about the expensive process of exiting its Arctic leases. The news of Chevron’s Arctic exit became public at the end of May. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency say that expanding coal, oil and gas supply will cause the Earth to warm beyond 1.5 degrees Celsuis &#8211; the limit to avert the worst impacts of climate change. To stop new fossil fuel projects, Green Century led unprecedented shareholder action to hold Chubb,* The Hartford,* and Travelers accountable, and Marketwatch reported on our advocacy in its </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/influential-fund-manager-green-century-tells-big-insurers-to-drop-big-oil-11645049047" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influential Fund Manager Tells Big Insurers to Drop Big Oil</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article.</span></p>
<p><b>7. Moving Beyond Plastic with our non-profit owners. </b>Green Century’s unique ownership by non-profits means that 100% of the net proceeds earned on managing the Green Century Funds belongs to the environmental and public health groups, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/about-us/">nine Public Interest Research Groups,</a> that founded us. In California, one of our owners, CALPIRG, <a href="https://pirg.org/updates/volunteers-organizers-leaders-celebrate-californias-landmark-plastic-reduction-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated the passage of the Plastic Pollution Producer Responsibility Act</a> in October. The new law requires companies to reduce the amount of plastic they use in their products, specifically mandating a 25% reduction in plastic packaging and foodware. The law additionally requires that all single-use food packaging be recyclable, so less ends up in landfills and the environment. As our owners pass state legislation to reduce plastic, the Green Century staff has successfully negotiated plastic reduction <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/?s=coca-cola">agreements with Coca-Cola</a>* and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/">Mattel</a>,* and kicked off the 2022-23 shareholder season by securing a majority vote on plastic reduction at <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/general-mills-shareholders-call-for-less-plastic-packaging-over-55-of-voting-shareholders-opt-for-green-century-proposal/">General Mills</a>*, which was the first majority vote on an environmental proposal this fall.</p>
<p><b>6. Receiving a Climate Change Leadership Award</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Pulitzer Prize-winning news organization selected the Green Century Funds President (me!) as one of the 30 honorees </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in its </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-action-30-top-global-leaders-working-toward-climate-solutions-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate Action 30 list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Announced to coincide with Climate Week in NYC this fall, the group of</span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-14548 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture2-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 includes global leaders from multiple sectors. I am very proud of how the Green Century Funds offer individuals, small businesses and organizations the opportunity to invest fossil fuel free and push companies to curb climate change so we move off of fossil fuels to a clean energy economy. </span></p>
<p><b>5. Challenging McDonald’s board…and spurring companies to act on factory farming</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>I was nominated to McDonald’s board of directors by Carl Icahn, one of the first “activist investors”,  to highlight the company’s broken<img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-14545 alignright" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pig-300x282.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="282" /> promise to end the use of gestation crates for pregnant sows. While McDonald’s has yet to live up to its initial commitment, the board campaign received widespread media coverage and the U.S. Humane Society has credited this visibility and pressure in moving CVS* and Walgreens* to accelerate their transitions to cage-free eggs and pushing General Mills* and Denny’s* to move towards elimination of gestation crates in their pork supply chains.</p>
<p><b>4. Protecting Forests and Biodiversity with one of the world&#8217;s largest home improvement retailers.</b> In March, Lowe’s agreed to accelerate its efforts to eliminate deforestation and the logging of old growth forests in its supply chains. Roughly 90% of Lowe&#8217;s wood comes from North America, including from Canada’s boreal forest, which constitutes 25% of the world’s remaining intact forest and is home to a rich variety of wildlife including the gray wolf. Canada’s boreal forest stores twice as much carbon per hectare as tropical forests, which was a key reason Green Century expanded our work in this region.</p>
<p><b>3. Banned and proud of it.</b> In August, Texas banned <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/">Green Century Funds</a>, along with 345 investment funds, from being used by state and some local entities because they don&#8217;t invest in the oil and gas industry. As one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds, Green Century has been an outspoken supporter of the global fossil fuel divestment campaign and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Divest-Invest-Movement-2-Pager-9.30.22.pdf">its success</a>. Mainstream asset managers such as Blackrock, which has <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tried to portray itself</a> as a sustainability leader, have gone to great lengths to now publicize how <i>much ($170 billion dollars)</i> they invest in these dirty industries in an effort to be removed from these lists in Texas, Louisiana and Florida. While I believe Blackrock is playing both sides of the field, the Green Century Funds are focused on reducing our reliance on dirty energy and are proud to be one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds. This year, we launched a campaign to convince insurance companies to stop underwriting new fossil fuel projects that was featured in Marketwatch’s article <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/influential-fund-manager-green-century-tells-big-insurers-to-drop-big-oil-11645049047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influential Fund Manager Green Century Tells Big Insurers to Drop Big Oil.</a></p>
<p><b>2. Pushing Costco to set greenhouse gas emissions targets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2021, Costco* refused to set climate emissions reduction targets when Green Century staff engaged with the company. After 70% of its voting shareholders supported the </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/equity-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century Equity Fund’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subsequent proposal on this issue and we held follow-up discussions with the company, Costco has now committed to setting carbon pollution reductions. This win is important because Costco was one of only three of the 50 largest S&amp;P companies without a major climate commitment last December and because it will set emissions reductions across its full supply chain &#8211; called “scope 3”emissions &#8211; which is the source of the majority of its emissions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>*Read President Leslie Samuelrich’s GreenFin article on What is real ‘shareholder engagement’ and does it matter? She explains the differences between proxy voting, engagement and advocacy&#8230;</em></p>
<p>When I got to the exhibit hall at a recent sustainable investing conference, surrounded by banners of beautiful nature shots, I focused on collecting impact reports from the exhibitors. Each was impressive in its own way &#8212; the charts, the photos or the sheer volume of the 32-page report that I ended up returning since it wouldn’t fit in my suitcase. </p>
<p>Over the last five years, impact reports have become standard fare for firms that claim their investment products make positive impacts on the world. As a fellow veteran of the responsible investing field leafed through a report, he quipped that he mostly skims the reports and looks at the photos. While his comment was partially in jest, I realized that even for seasoned investors, well-produced materials could make it difficult to discern the real differences between investments that purport to make an impact. </p>
<p>Most investors hold the largest majority of their investments in public equities, not community-based investing, private equity or green bonds, all of which offer direct ways to make a measurable impact. That makes for a straightforward impact report. However, while you can align your values to the mission of public equities, your shares make little difference to what the investment firm does. For example, you can invest in a fund that includes renewable energy companies, but your investment will not produce additional solar panels or wind turbines. This is an often overlooked reality, blurred by marketing materials that may imply a direct correlation between your investment and real changes in the environment by frequent use of buzzwords such as “impact” or “sustainable investing.” </p>
<p>If you want to impact the world, you should look for mutual funds or investment firms that have a shareholder engagement program. The number of firms that now tout “shareholder engagement” has proliferated as these institutions try to show (often in impact reports how their investments make a difference.</p>
<p>“Shareholder engagement” is a broad, unregulated term, otherwise known as stewardship or shareholder advocacy, which is the term that Green Century Funds uses. It can mean any activity that seeks to inform or persuade a company to change 1) how it reports or 2) how it handles an environmental, social or governance problem or opportunity.  Let’s break down the different approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Proxy voting</strong></p>
<p>This is the process of voting on a shareholder resolution that has been put forth by another investor (the company also asks for votes on questions that largely concern governance). Voting allows a firm to express its views but relies on other shareholders to identify the issue, propose a solution and get the shareholder resolution on the proxy ballot, sometimes after the company asks the Securities and Exchange Commission to not allow it on the ballot. This is the most common type of activity, because all mutual funds are supposed to vote on every shareholder resolution on the ballots. These resolutions are advisory, not binding, so a majority vote won’t necessarily result in the proposed change. However, a strong vote can provide useful leverage for the resolution proponent when they negotiate with the company.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong><br />
•	Does the investment firm have voting guidelines that you support?<br />
•	Do they vote in accordance with their guidelines for only their ESG products or all of their funds?<br />
•	Do they publish their voting guidelines and records on their website? </p>
<p><strong>What can be misleading:</strong><br />
•	Claiming that voting for a resolution directly resulted in a policy change<br />
•	Implying that voting on a resolution is the same as filing the resolution and leading the subsequent negotiations with the company  </p>
<p><strong>Company engagement</strong></p>
<p>Speaking to companies to gather information, analyze a holding or express a concern are forms of shareholder engagement. It does not always mean advocating for impactful change. Many firms roll all of their engagement questions into a regularly scheduled analyst meeting so your topic may be one of many covered in a conversation  </p>
<p>At The Green Century Funds, our engagements evaluate a company’s understanding of relevant environmental issues and risks we have identified. We want to see if the company needs to improve its policies or we want to ensure the company acts on commitments that we previously secured.  </p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong><br />
•	Results. What came about because of the engagement?  Was it a meeting to gather information and what did the info reveal?  </p>
<p>•	Does the firm provide data or stories on how a company has met the terms of a past agreement?<br />
<strong><br />
What can be misleading:</strong><br />
•	Number of “engagements.”  This number can show if a firm is tracking its work and the breadth of the conversations but does not indicate results. Each firm can count this number differently, so look for the firm’s definition of “engagement meeting.”</p>
<p>•	Private results. If a firm claims that its engagement produces results, it should provide evidence. Some firms, notably BlackRock, report on the frequency and topic issues included in discussions, but have resisted reporting on the results. That leaves investors in the dark about if and how companies change their practices vis-a-vis the engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Shareholder Advocacy</strong></p>
<p>By definition, this approach goes beyond seeking information to pressure a company to change a policy or practice. While shareholder advocacy programs frequently use proxy voting and engagement, the reverse is not frequently the case. </p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong><br />
•	Did the company change its policy?<br />
•	Is the policy measurable? For example: the 25% reduction in the use of new plastics that we persuaded Coca-Cola to adopt.<br />
•	Does the new policy have a deadline or timeline for implementation, or it is just an aspirational statement? Specifics are essential (i.e source 50% more renewable energy by 2025.). </p>
<p><strong>What can be misleading:</strong><br />
•	Issuing a report:  Having a company understand an issue and publicly report metrics on an issue is important for transparency. But companies can report without taking steps to change their practice or policy. If getting an agreement to do an assessment is reported as a success, the firm should also state what it has done with similar results in the past or plans.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><meta charset="utf-8"><strong>As Annual Meeting Season Winds Down, Policies to Improve Environment Are Underway</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Media Contacts: </strong>Thomas Peterson, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:tpeterson@greencentury.com">tpeterson@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2615; Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, <a href="mailto:mmorgenstein@greencentury.com">mmorgenstein@greencentury.com</a>, 678-427-1671</p>



<p><strong>Boston, June 9, 2022 – </strong>As the spate of annual spring shareholder meetings winds down, more than twenty major corporations have committed to action on key environmental proposals championed by Green Century.° Several of Green Century’s proposals achieved record-breaking majority shareholder votes over the course of this season. In addition, other innovative resolutions brought by Green Century achieved enough votes to provide momentum for future success.</p>



<p>“Between the undeniable science of climate change and the material risks that it may pose for investors and for companies across industries, it’s clearer than ever that we all need to do our part to protect our environment,” said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. “While individuals can make a difference, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what a large corporation can do. We applaud the shareholders who are holding their companies accountable and the companies that have committed to act on climate. And we’re making sure that those companies that are lagging notice that the wave of support for climate action is rising.”</p>



<p>Many of the environmentally focused shareholder resolutions presented this year attained higher percentages of yes votes than ever before. Mainstream asset managers – even the “Big Three:” BlackRock<em>, State Street</em> and Vanguard* – are increasingly acting on the potential risks to shareholder value posed by climate change and other environmental harms. Considering these higher proxy votes, corporate executives have more incentive to proactively address these issues, rather than have a public proxy fight in front of their shareholders and the media.</p>



<p>With that context, here’s a look at how Green Century’s proposals have influenced some of the world’s best-known brands to make commitments and take actions to improve our environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong><u>Corporate Actions and Commitments after Shareholder Proposals Filed by Green Century:</u></strong></h2>



<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/chevron-exits-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-after-green-century-shareholder-proposals-opposing-arctic-drilling/"><strong>Chevron</strong></a>* has abandoned plans to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and has ended its involvement in the Arctic following two successive shareholder proposals from Green Century. Green Century filed an <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/news/">initial proposal</a> calling on Chevron to renounce Arctic drilling in December 2020. Though Chevron publicly rebuffed that proposal, the company quietly went about the expensive process of exiting its Arctic leases. The news of Chevron’s Arctic exit finally became public at the end of May.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kroger-to-set-science-based-emissions-reduction-targets-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/"><strong>Kroger</strong></a><em>*</em> committed to set science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its full value chain, agreeing to the request of a Green Century shareholder proposal, withdrawn in April in exchange for this commitment. The shareholder proposal called on the largest U.S. grocery chain to set targets for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions that would lead to net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. Scope 1 and 2 emissions come from a company’s operations and purchased energy, while the emissions from its supply chains and using its products are Scope 3. Greenhouse gas emissions from the food system represent roughly a third of all planet-warming emissions.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="3">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/"><strong>Mattel</strong></a><strong>* </strong>announced in April that it plans to reduce the amount of plastic packaging with its products. The company, which makes a wide array of popular toys from Barbie dolls to Hot Wheels cars, <a href="https://corporate.mattel.com/news/mattel-announces-goal-to-reduce-plastic-packaging-by-25-per-product-by-2030-and-publishes-latest-citizenship-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a><a href="https://corporate.mattel.com/news/mattel-announces-goal-to-reduce-plastic-packaging-by-25-per-product-by-2030-and-publishes-latest-citizenship-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a>a new goal to reduce plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030. Mattel’s action comes after the toymaker reached an agreement last year with Green Century for the fund to withdraw a related shareholder proposal.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="4">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/lowes-commits-to-comprehensive-reporting-of-its-forest-footprint-will-also-explore-elimination-of-sourcing-from-primary-forests/"><strong>Lowe’s</strong></a>* agreed in March to accelerate its efforts to eliminate deforestation and the logging of old growth forests in its supply chains. Notably, Lowe’s is evaluating whether it can end sourcing from forests that have never been logged. Lowe’s is one of the world’s largest home improvement retailers and a major purchaser of wood products. Lowe’s largest competitor, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-majority-of-home-depot-shareholders-support-deforestation-shareholder-proposal-filed-by-green-century/"><strong>Home Depot</strong></a>,* would not agree to take action on a similar proposal, so Green Century brought it to a vote and 65% of the company’s shareholders instructed it to follow in Lowe’s footsteps in May.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="5">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-coca-cola-announces-refillable-packaging-goal-prompted-by-proposal-from-green-century-and-as-you-sow/"><strong>Coca-Cola</strong></a>* announced in February that it had set a <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/news/coca-cola-announces-industry-leading-target-for-reusable-packaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new goal</a> to have at least 25% of all beverages sold globally distributed in refillable or returnable bottles or in refillable containers through the company’s fountain business by 2030. It is the first known goal of its kind. Currently, reusable packaging accounts for 16% of the company’s beverage portfolio. The announcement comes after Green Century and As You Sow co-led the filing of a proposal urging the company to reduce its reliance on single-use plastic and increase its use of refillable and reusable packaging.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="6">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/"><strong>Apple</strong></a>* announced in November 2021 that it would provide individual consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products, starting with the iPhone 12 and 13 lineups. The announcement came on the same day that Green Century had to decide whether to press forward on a right-to-repair shareholder proposal. Apple has historically resisted allowing consumers or independent repair shops to perform repairs and has vigorously lobbied against legislation that would require them to allow others to fix their products. So, the announcement was a notable reversal for the company. Apple <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-apple-launches-self-service-repair-program/">launched the program</a> in April.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong><u>Recent Shareholder Votes That Can Provide Leverage for Green Century to Secure Policies:</u></strong></h2>



<ol start="7">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/amazon-shareholders-support-green-century-plastic-packaging-proposal/"><strong>Amazon</strong></a>* shareholders just missed garnering a majority vote in May for a proposal urging the company to significantly reduce its use of plastic packaging. The proposal earned 48.9% support, the highest-ever vote in favor of an environmentally focused shareholder proposal at the company, according to a <a href="https://engagements.ceres.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ceres database</a> that tracks shareholder proposals. When Green Century and As You Sow filed a similar proposal last year, it earned support from 35% of shareholders. At the time, <em>that</em> was the new standard for environmentally focused proposals at Amazon. Despite the increasing shows of support for improving plastic policies, the leading e-retailer has yet to adequately respond to investor concerns.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="8">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/votes-on-green-century-proposal-at-travelers-concludes-series-of-filings-at-major-insurers/"><strong>Chubb,* Travelers,* and The Hartford</strong></a>,* three of the fifteen largest commercial property and casualty insurance companies in the world, had shareholder votes on their ballots in May related to Green Century’s new “Insure a Fossil Free Future” campaign. Green Century filed virtually the same proposal with each company, asking them to align with climate science and stop underwriting fossil fuel expansion. The proposals garnered “for” votes from <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb/">19.4%, 13.2%, and 8.8%</a> of the insurers’ shareholders, respectively, exceeding the thresholds required to re-file the proposal at each company.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="9">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/majority-of-costco-shareholders-support-landmark-green-century-proposal-on-climate-change/"><strong>Costco</strong></a><strong>* </strong>shareholders in January voted overwhelmingly in favor of a Green Century proposal requesting that the company set targets for emissions throughout its full value chain that are aligned with achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Nearly 70% of voting shareholders sent a signal that it is unacceptable that Costco lacks science-based emissions reduction targets and fails to account for Scope 3 emissions related to agriculture, land use change and deforestation in its supply chains. Leading up to the January vote, Green Century’s proposal prompted substantial improvements in Costco’s climate policy. Costco announced an expedited timeline for disclosing supply chain emissions; committed to developing a Scope 3 action plan and reduction targets; and most significantly, nearly a year earlier than planned, announced its first reduction targets for its operational and purchased energy (Scope 1 and 2) emissions. A similar Green Century proposal received a remarkable 88.5% vote at <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-green-century-shareholder-proposal-on-climate-change-wins-vote-with-88-5-approval-at-us-foods-annual-meeting/"><strong>US Foods</strong></a>* in May.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong><u>Green Century’s Work and Influence on Factory Farming:</u></strong></h2>



<ol start="10">
<li><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/"><strong>McDonald’s</strong></a>* has been a frequent target of Green Century’s shareholder advocacy in recent years because of the fast-food giant’s reliance on unsustainable factory farming practices. In 2022, Green Century’s work on this issue was thrust into the spotlight when famed investor Carl Icahn nominated Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich to McDonald’s board of directors. While shareholders opted not to elect Samuelrich, the publicity raised awareness of Green Century’s work on animal welfare issues and we’ve seen an uptick in improved animal welfare policies from numerous other companies, presumably to avoid a board seat fight of their own. Green Century’s actions have provided leverage to partners doing the heavy lifting on similar campaigns. For example, the U.S. Humane Society has credited the McDonald’s board fight with helping pressure <strong>CVS*</strong> and <strong>Walgreens*</strong> to accelerate their transitions to cage-free eggs, pushing <strong>General Mills*</strong> and <strong>Denny’s*</strong> to move towards elimination of gestation crates in their pork supply chains, and leading to new commitments from <strong>Conagra Brands*</strong> and the<strong> Cheesecake Factory*</strong> to make progress on both cage-free eggs and gestation crate-free pork. </li>

<p><em>Stocks will fluctuate in response to factors that may affect a single company, industry, sector, country, region or the market as a whole and may perform worse than the market. Foreign securities are subject to additional risks such as currency fluctuations, regional economic and political conditions, differences in accounting methods, and other unique risks compared to investing in securities of U.S. issuers. Bonds are subject to a variety of risks including interest rate, credit, and inflation risk. A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>
