<p>Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, <a href="mailto:asanders@greencentury.com">asanders@greencentury.com</a>, 773-272-6691</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, April 22, 2024</strong> – Archer-Daniels-Midland Company* (ADM), one of the largest agricultural companies in the world, has released a <a href="https://www.adm.com/en-us/sustainability/no-conversion-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> that informed a <a href="https://www.adm.com/globalassets/sustainability/goals--programs/protect-biodiversity-forests-communities/11-2023-protect-biodiversity-forests-communities-enlgish.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new policy</a> to enhance protections for South American ecosystems key to global biodiversity and the fight against climate change. ADM’s new policy will eliminate primary native vegetation conversion, or the repurposing of wild land for crops such as soy and corn, from its global supply chains by 2025 for direct suppliers and by 2027 for indirect suppliers.</p>
<p>“Critical ecosystems like the Cerrado, Gran Chaco and Pantanal may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they’re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds°. “We congratulate ADM on enhancing protections for these special places.”</p>
<p><strong>Shareholder Proposal Prompted Study, Protections </strong></p>
<p>In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Robeco and BNP Paribas Asset Management, ADM had agreed in spring 2023 to conduct a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/adm-moves-to-strengthen-no-deforestation-policy/">feasibility study</a> to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its South American soy and corn supply chains and issue a correlated commitment. The feasibility study completed in November 2023 and published in April 2024 informed ADM’s new “no-conversion” commitment, which covers supply chains in the Brazilian Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, as well as the Paraguayan and Argentinian Chaco.</p>
<p>“We believe ADM has made significant progress in ensuring business continuity in an increasingly fragile ecosystem by having a clear outlook on key areas needing protection across its supply chain,” said Peter van der Werf, Head of Engagement at Robeco. “Importantly, the assessment allows ADM to prioritize already degraded land fit for further agricultural expansion, allowing it to steer investments and help farmers to move forward in a sustainable manner.”</p>
<p>Native vegetation conversion <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrades ecosystems such as the Cerrado</a> savanna in Brazil that are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Soy production is a <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of native vegetation conversion</a> in South American habitats and contributes to a broader decline of South American wilderness.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, February 9, 2023 </strong>– Archer-Daniels-Midland Company* (ADM), one of the <a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/top-lists/top-10-companies-from-agriculture-industry-in-US-by-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest agricultural companies in the world</a>, has agreed to take important steps to help protect South American ecosystems critical to the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century Funds<em>°</em>, Robeco, and BNP Paribas Asset Management, ADM agreed to conduct a feasibility study in 2023 to determine when it can eliminate “native vegetation conversion” from its soy and corn supply chains in South America and issue a correlated commitment. In exchange, investors withdrew the proposal. Native vegetation conversion, or repurposing wild land for agriculture and other uses, <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/soy-made-the-cerrado-a-breadbasket-climate-change-may-end-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrades ecosystems such as the Cerrado</a> savanna in Brazil that are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.</p>
<p>“Places like the Cerrado may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they’re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, Green Century Funds’ president. “ADM’s commitment is an important step toward getting these critical biomes the safeguards they need.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Food &amp; agriculture contributes one-third of global climate emissions</strong></span></h3>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.adm.com/globalassets/sustainability/sustainability-reports/adm-h2-2021-soy-progress-report-compressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADM reported 97% deforestation- and conversion-free volumes for Brazilian soy</a> and announced at COP27 a commitment to <a href="https://www.tropicalforestalliance.org/assets/Agriculture-Sector-Roadmap-January-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct a global assessment in 2023</a> of the risk of native vegetation conversion to soy production. Green Century’s proposal asked ADM to expand its current plan to include an independently verified commitment to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its global supply chains by 2025.</p>
<p>“The global food and agriculture industry contributes about <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third</a> of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annie Sanders</a>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century Funds. “We look forward to working with ADM to eliminate native vegetation conversion in its supply chains as soon as possible in South America – and beyond.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Soy production is a leading cause of native vegetation conversion in South America</strong></span></h3>
<p>Soy production is a <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of native vegetation conversion</a> in South American biomes and part of a broader decline of South American wilderness. As the world’s most biodiverse savanna, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Cerrado houses 5% of the world’s animals and plants</a> including vulnerable species such as jaguars, maned wolves and giant anteaters. The <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/gran-chaco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Chaco</a> forest between the Cerrado and the Andes Mountains is the second-largest forest in South America, behind only the Amazon rainforest. Agriculture is projected to supplant millions of additional acres of native vegetation in the Gran Chaco by 2030.</p>
<p>“Forests are not the only landscapes that need protection. The Cerrado, for example, feeds 8 of 12 of Brazil’s major river basins and three aquifers. Native vegetation clearance has already been linked to decreased rainfall,” said Adam Kanzer, head of stewardship, Americas for BNP Paribas Asset Management. “Current policies could lead to very serious near-term consequences for Brazilian agriculture and human health. We commend ADM for agreeing to take a hard look at what it would take to adopt a more holistic approach to its most important South American supply chains.”</p>
<p>“By signing the COP26 Glasgow deforestation pledge, Robeco has committed to work towards eliminating agricultural-driven deforestation from our investment portfolios by 2025. For many years our engagement has focused on forest biomes such as the Amazon and boreal forests. However, with increasing corporate and legislative action on deforestation, pressures on non-forest biomes such as the Cerrado and Gran Chaco are growing.” says Peter van der Werf, Executive Director Active Ownership at Robeco. “By strengthening their approach to wider native vegetation conversion, ADM is protecting its license to operate and moving towards a future proof business model, safeguarding their key productive assets: the land and ecosystem services they depend on.”</p>
