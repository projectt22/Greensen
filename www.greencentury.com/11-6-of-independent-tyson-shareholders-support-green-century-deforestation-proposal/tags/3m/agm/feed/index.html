<p><strong>Boston, April 24, 2025 – </strong>6.4% of the Chemours Company’s* voting shareholders supported a resolution on Tuesday asking the company to adopt a policy to assess biodiversity impacts before mining in ecologically sensitive areas. Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, and the Felician Sisters of North America filed the proposal.</p>



<p>“Chemours should more thoroughly assess biodiversity risks before they can’t turn back the clock,” <strong>said Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>. “Since Chemours mines near ecological gems such as the Okefenokee Swamp, taking extra care to prevent irreversible damage to nature is a no-brainer.”</p>



<p>Chemours, which DuPont spun off in 2015, manufactures and sells “performance chemicals,” including titanium dioxide, a common whitener in products from toothpaste to sunscreen. Most of Chemours’ mining operations are in the North American Coastal Plain, a <a href="https://www.cepf.net/our-work/biodiversity-hotspots/north-american-coastal-plain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global biodiversity hotspot</a>, where mining-related impacts such as lowered groundwater levels, water pollution and habitat degradation would be particularly destructive.</p>



<p><strong>Mining in ecologically sensitive areas can drive biodiversity loss and climate change</strong></p>



<p>Overwhelming scientific consensus indicates that mining near the Okefenokee would significantly damage the swamp by drawing down its water level, tripling the frequency of drought and increasing the risk of <a href="https://www.fws.gov/story/2024-04/faq-okefenokee-nwr-and-twin-pines-mine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfires</a>. These repercussions would destroy swamp wildlife habitat, damage thousands of acres of adjacent private timberland and release millions of tons of climate-warming <a href="https://garivers.org/protectokefenokee-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions</a>.</p>



<p>“Habitat loss affects not only the land and its inhabitants but also the people who depend on the natural resources,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.felician.org/2020/10/28/sister-mary-jean-sliwinski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Sister Jean Sliwinski</strong></a><strong>, Province Sustainability Coordinator for the Felician Sisters of North America.</strong> “A broader, more long-term approach to assessing potential mining impacts is vital.”</p>



<p>Chemours doesn’t currently assess potentially irreversible biodiversity impacts from its mining operations, lagging a number of peers that do. The company also has a checkered environmental track record that has cost it nearly $1 billion since 2015 for various violations and <a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/?company_op=starts&amp;company=chemours&amp;offense_group=environment-related+offenses&amp;agency_code=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spills</a>. The recently voted-on proposal argued that an enhanced biodiversity assessment policy would reduce systemic, financial and competitive risks for the company.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone would say that slightly whiter toothpaste is worth irreversible biodiversity loss,” <strong>said Green Century Director of Shareholder Advocacy </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “We&#8217;ll keep pressing Chemours to ensure that it considers and protects biodiversity before mining starts. That’s what’s best for investors, customers, and the planet.”</p>
