<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495<br />
Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA, 2023) &#8211; </strong>Following shareholder engagement by Green Century°, Alphabet* announced that it plans to extend software updates for Chromebooks for up to ten years starting in 2024, and that no existing Chromebooks will expire in the next two years. It is estimated the changes in policy could impact up to 120 million computers currently on the market.</p>
<p>The multiple year extension by the parent company of Google* allows schools and families to keep functioning Chromebooks to remain in use, preventing those items from becoming e-waste.</p>
<p>“This is a major win for the environment, schools, and the shareholder advocacy process,” said Douglass Guernsey, a Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management. “By extending the life of Chromebooks commonly used in schools, Alphabet is getting ahead of addressing potential risks and making sure hardware using its software can be used for as long as possible.”</p>
<h3><strong>Green Century and Consumer Activists Help Consumers and School Districts</strong></h3>
<p>Green Century discuss risks raised by the “<a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PIRG-Chromebook-Churn-Full-Report-May-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook Churn</a>” published by <a href="https://pirg.org/resources/what-is-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIRG</a> (Public Interest Research Groups) directly with Alphabet management in Summer 2023. Chromebook’s “Auto Update Expiration” date would cause millions of Chromebooks to stop working even if the hardware was still functioning. The report showed that extending the life of Chromebooks could result in <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/chromebook-churn-report-highlights-problems-of-short-lived-laptops-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 billion dollars</a> in savings for taxpayers and could save millions of tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Green Century has previously engaged Alphabet on improving reparability of its <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-withdraws-right-to-repair-shareholder-proposal-after-google-parent-alphabet-agrees-to-make-pixel-replacement-parts-available/">Pixel phones</a> and disclosing details of the company’s <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/google-parent-alphabet-pledges-greater-transparency-on-use-of-carbon-offsets-after-green-century-shareholder-proposal-2/">carbon offsets</a>. Both previous engagements resulted in changes from management to address environmental concerns.</p>

					<p><b>Media Contacts: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, June 26, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Green Century° withdrew a shareholder proposal with tech giant Alphabet after the company agreed to provide greater visibility into its use of carbon offsets.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://abc.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alphabet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relies on carbon offsets, also known as carbon credits, to neutralize the emissions it’s not able to eliminate through other methods, such as through energy efficiency or renewable energy. Following the Green Century engagement, the company has now agreed to annually disclose its criteria, approach, and portfolio, including details on project purchases and any relevant certifications related to its purchases of carbon offsets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite earlier commitments and a </span><a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//green/pdfs/google-carbon-offsets.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing its strategy for buying “high-quality carbon offsets,” which are known for longevity and verifiability, Alphabet’s full disclosure in 2022 fell short. In a single sentence in its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual environmental report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company vaguely stated “[We] plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on carbon offsets to neutralize emissions is currently an area of intense debate. Some academics and NGOs are urging potential buyers to be cautious as research about how different projects absorb carbon, methodology for measuring offsets, and ability to verify the durability of the offsets evolve.  At minimum, more robust disclosure may be advised, and the agreement secured by Green Century should help investors better assess  Alphabet’s carbon offset purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m pleased that Alphabet sees the value in revisiting its carbon offsets disclosure policy,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Green Century, and I expect many, many investors, value insight into how Alphabet is managing its climate risk.  I believe embracing transparency will only help it select offsets wisely and avoid the greenwashing label.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has weighed in on the issue. In its proposed climate rule, the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SEC expresses an interest in learning how companies use carbon offsets to reach their climate-related goals, and the regulator may require companies to disclose their carbon reductions represented by these offsets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alphabet is a leader in many respects &#8211; the amount of renewable energy it procures, the energy efficiency it incorporates, and its ability to maintain carbon neutrality. Becoming a leader in carbon offsets seems like a natural step forward,” added Shareholder Advocate </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I think our proposal was a wake up call for Alphabet. Investors like us are analyzing corporate climate commitments very closely, and we want to see that claims of emissions reductions using offsets are actually true.”</span></p>

<p><strong>Google joins Right to Repair movement with its announcement</strong></p>



<p>Media Release Contact: Josh Chetwynd, jchetwynd@greencentury.com, 303-573-5558; Annalisa Tarizzo, atarizzo@greencentury.com, (781) 349-2789</p>



<p><strong>Boston, April 12, 2022 &#8212;</strong> Green Century is withdrawing a shareholder proposal with Google parent Alphabet as the company announced on Friday that it will begin selling genuine Pixel phone parts to independent repair shops and consumers. Green Century’s&nbsp;proposal urged Alphabet to make repairing its products more accessible to consumers and independent repair shops.</p>



<p>“We’re glad to see Google join the Right to Repair movement and catch up with its industry peers by announcing this new initiative,” said Green Century Capital Management President Leslie Samuelrich. “Today’s announcement underscores consumer demand for repair options, the wave of change in the tech industry around product repair, and the power of shareholders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The replacement parts will be available for sale through iFixit, an online repair guide provider and Right to Repair advocate, and will cover models from the Pixel 2 through the Pixel 6 Pro, as well as future models. The announcement is a striking reversal for the company, which has long lobbied against Right to Repair reforms and employed policies that make repairing its products difficult.</p>



<p>“Access to spare parts is a critical component of Right to Repair,” Samuelrich said. “It helps companies like Alphabet mitigate risk by keeping electronic waste from smartphones out of the landfill, fulfilling consumer expectations for more repair options, and preparing for potential regulatory requirements at both the state and federal level, especially in light of the Federal Trade Commission’s recent statements on this issue.”</p>



<p>Alphabet’s announcement comes in the wake of similar ones made in the last year by Apple,* Microsoft,* and Samsung,* which have all committed to increasing repair accessibility for the devices they sell. Apple’s announcement was similarly prompted by a Green Century shareholder proposal.</p>



<p>Making replacement parts more widely available is key to the Right to Repair and provides numerous environmental benefits by keeping devices in use for longer periods of time, such as reducing toxic electronic waste and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacturing process.</p>



<p>“This is a positive development, and we encourage the company to expand its spare part offerings to all of its devices, including for its Nest Thermostats, and making a formal commitment to stop lobbying against Right to Repair reforms,” Samuelrich said.</p>
