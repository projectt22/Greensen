<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 – </strong>13.9% of shareholder votes Wednesday were cast in favor of a resolution asking Amazon to report the climate emissions from all of its retail sales. Green Century,° along with shareholder representative <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a><em>,</em> filed the resolution with the retail giant on behalf of shareholders.</p>



<p>“Amazon is failing to provide transparent and complete data on its emissions,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Without a clear picture of Amazon’s emissions, investors cannot analyze the company’s climate impact and associated risks.”</p>



<p>Amazon does not report emissions <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with 99% of the company’s retail sales</a><strong><em>.</em></strong> Unlike its peers <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/esgreport/our-esg-priorities/2023%20CDP%20Climate%20Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mobilecontent.costco.com/staging/resource/img/25w03130/5a_ClimateActionPlan_FY24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco</a>* and <a href="https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/c70c48ab-0e10-4576-9e92-789e30665964/2023-CDP-Climate-Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target</a>*, the company only publishes the emissions of its Amazon-branded products, which make up a mere 1% of retail <a href="https://www.momentumcommerce.com/amazons-private-label-market-share-shrinks-by-6-year-over-year-in-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a>.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s emissions disclosures do not align with the global standard for corporate greenhouse gas reporting, which its major peers are following,” <strong>said Parker Caswell, climate and energy senior associate at <em>As You Sow</em>. </strong>&#8220;Amazon must live up to investor expectations and report more than the emissions from products that make up just <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of its sales</a>.”</p>



<p>Despite investor concern, and coming regulations in <a href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/sustainability-reporting-and-auditing-scope-3-supplier-emissions#DoScope3EmissionsNeedToBeReported" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the European Union</a> (EU) and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> that may mandate more detailed disclosures, Amazon has not indicated it will improve its reporting.</p>



<p><strong>Amazon fails to measure up to climate commitments</strong></p>



<p>The retail sector is responsible for <a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-retailer-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% of global greenhouse gas emissions,</a> which means large retailers can play a crucial role in tackling the climate crisis. Amazon recognized this in declaring its <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/planet/climate-pledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious target to cut emissions</a> by 2040, citing the need for meaningful action to halt climate change.</p>



<p>While Amazon has set targets to tackle climate change, it has also faced <a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/why-amazons-own-employees-are-calling-it-out-for-greenwashing-ff7ace354cb7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaints from its employees</a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250314136610/en/Hagens-Berman-Amazon-Faces-Consumer-Lawsuit-Alleging-Deforestation-Behind-Amazon-Basics-Paper-Products-and-Greenwashing-Cover-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal challenges from customers</a> on the accuracy of its climate disclosures and marketing.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s climate mitigation efforts should match the scale of its business, “<strong> said</strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong> </strong></a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“It’s time for Amazon to live up to its own climate ambition and investor expectations for mitigating climate-related risks.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 15, 2025</strong> – On May 21, Amazon shareholders will vote on a proposal asking Amazon to disclose the total climate emissions associated with its retail sales. This is the second year Green Century<em>°</em> and shareholder representative <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a> are requesting that Amazon more comprehensively measure the greenhouse gas footprint of the products that contribute to its retail sales.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s status as a dominant global retailer means its products have a massive climate impact,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Failing to report full product emissions is failing to disclose significant climate risk to investors.”</p>



<p><strong>Amazon’s climate footprint exceeds its reporting efforts</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retail sector is responsible for <a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-retailer-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% </a>of global greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the largest U.S. retailers, including <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/esgreport/our-esg-priorities/2023%20CDP%20Climate%20Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mobilecontent.costco.com/staging/resource/img/25w03130/5a_ClimateActionPlan_FY24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco</a>* and <a href="https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/c70c48ab-0e10-4576-9e92-789e30665964/2023-CDP-Climate-Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target</a>,* already measure and report emissions from the majority of their products.</p>



<p>Amazon only discloses <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the emissions related to its Amazon-branded products</a>, which comprise <a href="https://www.momentumcommerce.com/amazons-private-label-market-share-shrinks-by-6-year-over-year-in-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 1% of its total sales</a>.&nbsp;This excludes a significant amount of Amazon’s products—and their climate impact.</p>



<p>“Despite Amazon being an <a href="https://nrf.com/research-insights/top-retailers/top-50-global-retailers/top-50-global-retailers-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international leader in retail sales</a>, the company lags in emissions reporting,” said<strong> Parker Caswell, </strong><strong>climate and energy senior associate at As You Sow</strong>. “This limited reporting makes Amazon’s emissions appear much smaller than they actually are.”</p>



<p>“Amazon’s lack of transparency about its climate pollution leaves investors in the dark about the company’s exposure to climate risk,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Information on risk is a foundation of disclosures and something every shareholder and potential shareholder deserves: The climate-related risks of Amazon’s total greenhouse gas emissions are no exception.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 7, 2024</strong> – Shareholders prepare to vote on a Green Century <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465924040871/tm2318496-d4_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a> at Ford’s May 9 annual general meeting. The proposal asks Ford to disclose deforestation risk associated with the leather, rubber, and minerals it buys, and encourages the company to support efforts to expand supplies of green steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for  car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raising cattle</a>, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting rubber</a>, and <a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/1827220/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining minerals</a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage. However, the company is silent on how these materials could lead to long-term environmental damage, especially in vulnerable areas like Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Ford has committed to buying <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/11/09/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green primary steel and aluminum for 10%</a> of its total purchase by 2030. Yet not one ton of green steel or aluminum is manufactured currently in the United States. The proposal asks Ford how it will attain its 2030 goal and to join NGO-led organizations like ResponsibleSteel and the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative (ASI), which support sustainable production of these metals.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled that Ford is advancing quickly to manufacture climate friendly vehicles – like EVs,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “But the company faces material risk in its supply chain from the products it uses. Companies have to be relentless in investigating and changing their total impact on the environment.”</p>
<p><strong>Competitors Exceed Ford On Green Steel and Aluminum </strong></p>
<p>Volvo and Mercedes-Benz participate in the steel plant sustainability standard, <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a>, and Volvo has joined <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/about-steelzero-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelZero</a>, where members commit purchasing 100% green steel by 2050. Ford would be the first North American auto manufacturer to participate in these initiatives and could accelerate the wider availability of green metals.</p>
<p>“Ford’s Road to Better slogan describes its commitment to building a more sustainable  transportation future,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Instead of  fighting our proposal at the ballot box, we want Ford to remain on the Road to Better. We believe Ford should implement our proposal to protect nature and biodiversity and ensure it supports  development of steel and aluminum manufacturing that is powered by renewable energy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					<p><strong>Boston, April 29, 2024</strong> – Bunge Global SA*, a leading global agribusiness company, has agreed to report on deforestation and conversion risks in its supply chain and take immediate corrective action to protect tropical ecosystems. The commitment came in response to a shareholder proposal from six investors – Green Century°, AXA Investment Managers, Nordea Asset Management, Schroders, Storebrand Asset Management and UBS Asset Management – asking the company to address deforestation risks driven by its current policies.</p>
<p>In exchange for withdrawal of the proposal, Bunge also committed to 100% geospatial monitoring for soy and enhanced disclosure of traceability for indirect suppliers (where soy is mixed from multiple farms). The report will cover both legal and illegal deforestation, as well as native vegetation conversion, or the repurposing of wild land for agriculture.</p>
<p>“Biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon and Cerrado, home to animals from jaguars to giant otters, are the last places we should be clearing forests for food,” said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “We congratulate Bunge on taking steps to more fully protect the rich biodiversity of these special places.”</p>
<h3><strong>Investors Concerned About a “Race to Deforest”</strong></h3>
<p>In 2021, Green Century and Storebrand filed a shareholder resolution asking Bunge to accelerate efforts to eliminate conversion from its supply chain, which received a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">98% majority vote</a> with support from the board. Although the company had already committed to eliminate deforestation by 2025, investors remained concerned that its 2025 “<a href="https://www.feedandgrain.com/sustainability/news/15541156/report-links-bunge-to-soyrelated-deforestation#:~:text=Bunge%20confirmed%20to%20Mighty%20Earth%20that%20it%20does%20not%20have,its%20supply%20chain%20until%202025." target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut-off date</a>,” which allows the company to buy crops from land deforested through the end of 2025, effectively incentivizes a race to deforest until that date.</p>
<p>”Bunge’s 2025 target is great, but without a cut-off date in the past, there is a risk that farmers will rush to clear forests for new fields before the deforestation ban kicks in,” said Vemund Olsen, senior sustainability analyst at Storebrand Asset Management. “We’re glad to see that Bunge has committed to report on the risk of inadvertently incentivizing deforestation and we hope the company will take appropriate corrective action.”</p>
<p>Deforestation and native vegetation conversion <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrade ecosystems such as the Cerrado</a> savanna in Brazil that are critical to preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Soy production is a <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of native vegetation conversion</a> in South American habitats and contributes to a broader decline of South American wilderness.</p>
<p>“The global agribusiness industry as a whole should do more to protect complex and valuable ecosystems,” said Michaela Zhirova, engagement specialist at Nordea Asset Management. “We hope any progress Bunge makes would help to lift the baseline for the entire sector.”</p>
<h3><strong>Pressure Mounts to Halt Deforestation</strong></h3>
<p>The urgency of the twin climate and biodiversity crises coupled with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/policies-tackling-deforestation-pose-investor-risk-report-says-2024-03-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 new policies last year</a> to halt deforestation and nature loss highlight the imperative for companies to eliminate deforestation by 2025. The highly concentrated agribusiness sector is under particular pressure to reduce its environmental and biodiversity footprint, as reputational risk and the risk of market access disruption due to emerging regulation could prove a persistent threat to business models.</p>
<p>“Deforestation risk in this region is directly linked to managing investment risk on behalf of our clients,” said Sarah Woodfield, biodiversity engagement lead at Schroders. “The current economic factors driving demand for soy have prompted us to ask companies like Bunge to more fully address related risks.”</p>
<p>The agreement marks a new phase in the multi-year deforestation engagement with Bunge. The investor group plans to continue its dialogue with the company on these and connected issues, and on the fulfillment of Bunge’s most recent commitments.</p>
<p>“Companies and their investors have a key role to play in driving meaningful change in value chains, particularly in critical biomes,” said Sanders. “We’re hopeful that Bunge will achieve deforestation and conversion-free supply chains as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocacy, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 20, 2023</strong> – General Motors released the results of the shareholder vote on a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/">Green Century</a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/"><em>°</em></a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/"> proposal</a> asking the company to improve the sustainability of its aluminum, steel, rubber, and leather supply chains. Votes cast in favor reached 14.3% for this first-year proposal, which asked the company to disclose the environmental impacts of these key materials, procure more low-carbon aluminum and steel, and eliminate deforestation associated with producing leather and rubber.</p>
<p>In recent years, General Motors has set several <a href="https://www.gmsustainability.com/_pdf/resources-and-downloads/GM_2022_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggressive targets</a> – one to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 and another to make and sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035. However, the company has not established clear targets for procuring green steel or aluminum, even though both industries can electrify some of their operations and use renewable energy to do so. Further, GM has yet to join industry associations such as <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a><a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>TM</sup></a>, a coalition which created a certification system for green steel and is working to increase customer demand for green steel manufacturing.</p>
<p>Additionally, GM may be sourcing leather and rubber used for car interiors and tires from areas that are associated with deforestation. For example, in Brazil, which is considered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major source of leather</a> for U.S. auto manufacturers, raising cattle is a leading cause of deforestation. The growth and expansion of rubber plantations in Southeast Asia and West Africa – the two primary areas in the world where latex for car tires is harvested – threatens the destruction of biodiverse ecosystems in those regions. Nevertheless, GM currently lacks public targets, milestones and metrics that would indicate progress toward eliminating its exposure to deforestation from rubber plantation expansion or destruction of tropical forests from cattle ranching.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said:</strong></p>
<p>“We believe that even with a full transition to electric cars and trucks by 2035, GM has exposure to significant environmental risks. Ultimately, we don’t think GM wants to be associated with deforestation. If the company wants to clean up its steel and aluminum supply chains, it should invest now in the transition to low-carbon steel and aluminum. Waiting only postpones much needed emissions cuts across the globe.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, Green Century shareholder advocate, added:   </strong></p>
<p>“As one of the largest auto companies in the world, GM has a leadership role to play in addressing climate and deforestation risk. Many European auto companies, such as BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Volvo, are making commitments to source low-carbon metals. GM has an opportunity to catch up and lead the way for American manufacturers. Moreover, few manufacturers are addressing deforestation risk within their supply chains. GM could set an industry-wide standard by adopting near-term targets for zero deforestation.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Director of Communications, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</p>
<p><strong>Boston, April 20, 2023</strong> &#8212; On April 10th, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) upheld Amazon.com Inc.’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gccmamazon040723-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request </a>to block a Green Century° and Amalgamated Bank shareholder proposal from its 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal seeks full disclosure of Amazon&#8217;s scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, which includes emissions associated with the production and use of third-party products and transportation, waste generation, and business travel. Amazon currently publishes only a portion of its scope 3 emissions.</p>
<p>Amazon competitors Walmart and Target quantify, estimate where needed, and disclose all relevant categories of their scope 3 value chain emissions, as defined by the widely-referenced GHG Protocol. In its argument to the SEC, Amazon claimed that Green Century and Amalgamated Bank’s proposal, which asked it to report on its entire emissions footprint according to Protocol guidelines, constituted micromanagement. However, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon failed to emphasize</a> in its letter to the SEC that it currently reports by using the Protocol’s definitions for the scopes 1 &#8211; 3 emissions that it does <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2021-ghg-verification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclose</a>.</p>
<p>Industry experts report that scope 3 emissions often constitute between 70% and 99% of companies’ greenhouse gas emissions footprint, and according to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/09/scope-emissions-climate-greenhouse-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Economic Forum</a>, “Companies will need to cut emissions across all three scopes to meet internationally agreed targets on global warming.” By not accounting for its full greenhouse gas footprint, Amazon may be failing to address all emissions related to running its ecommerce, retail stores, and web services. The company may be in danger of failing to meet its ambitious climate goals.</p>
<p>In reaction to the news, Green Century President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a> expressed disappointment, “Amazon has been a leader on climate by aggressively developing wind projects and supporting the roll out of electric vehicle delivery trucks. It’s troubling that Amazon is blocking shareholders from expressing their opinions on the company’s full exposure to climate risk.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Amazon and the firm, Global Optimism, launched the <a href="https://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Pledge</a>, inviting companies across the globe to “commit to net-zero by 2040 across all emissions scopes.” It is yet unclear the scopes of emissions that Amazon includes in its net-zero by 2040 goal. Walmart and Target report that 97% and  95% of their emissions come from scope 3 sources. According to Amazon, its scope 3 emissions represent only 78% of its total emissions &#8211; that is, only for the scope 3 emissions it actually publishes.</p>
<p>“How are we supposed to assess Amazon’s full climate risk if it’s holding back material information from investors and stakeholders?” questioned Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “Amazon is undermining other companies’ good faith efforts to disclose upstream, downstream, and operational emissions. As the UN Secretary just quipped, &#8216;Our world needs climate action on all fronts: everything, everywhere, all at once.’ Disclosure and action are key to reaching the world’s climate goals.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, mmorgenstein@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 9, 2023</strong> &#8212; Amazon.com Inc. released its Q4 2022 results on Thursday. The leading online retailer has begun Q1 of 2023 by sending a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 20 arguing that a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-as-you-sow-file-shareholder-proposal-with-amazon-seeking-disclosure-of-entire-carbon-footprint/">shareholder proposal</a> put forward by Green Century° and Amalgamated Bank should be blocked from the company’s 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal requests that Amazon measure and disclose all of its scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions related to its physical stores and e-commerce operations. In its 16-page letter, Amazon writes to the SEC that the “Proposal seeks to micromanage the Company” and improperly restricts its ability to choose which scope 3 emissions to report.</p>
<p>“Amazon has an obligation to ensure that investors and potential investors know its material risks so they can make prudent decisions. Disclosure is at the heart of this process,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Our proposal simply asks Amazon to do what Walmart and Target are already doing &#8212; using well-established standards to report indirect emissions associated with running their businesses. We’re disappointed that Amazon is choosing to resist sharing this data, forcing investors to take this to the ballot box.”</p>
<p>“Investors want more transparency into what Amazon is including in its carbon footprint and why, dollar-for-dollar, Walmart and Target report more emissions than Amazon &#8212; by a long shot,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Amazon launched its “<a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/environment/the-climate-pledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Pledge</a>” four years ago and invited other companies to commit to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. On the one hand, Amazon has been a climate leader, but on the other, its refusal to disclose its full carbon footprint, means its pledges could just be greenwashing.”</p>
<p>Although Amazon has not announced a date yet for its 2023 annual general meeting of shareholders, history suggests it will be held near the end of May.</p>
