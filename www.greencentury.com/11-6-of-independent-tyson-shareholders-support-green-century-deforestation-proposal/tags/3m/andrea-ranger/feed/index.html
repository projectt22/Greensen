					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 3, 2024</strong> – Twenty-two percent of shares were cast in favor of Green Century’s° proposal asking The Timken Company* (Timken) to establish emissions reduction targets that align with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C.</p>
<p>Timken set a 2022 goal to reduce its climate emissions by <a href="https://investors.timken.com/financial-news/press-release/2023/Timken-Releases-Annual-CSR-Report-Provides-Update-on-2030-Emissions-Intensity-Target-Progress/default.aspx#:~:text=Announced%20in%202022%20and%20measured,than%20it%20did%20in%202018." target="_blank" rel="noopener">50% by 2030</a>, but its target does not include indirect sources of emissions that typically comprise about <a href="http://chrome-extension:/bpconcjcammlapcogcnnelfmaeghhagj/edit.html" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of many companies’ climate emissions.</p>
<p>Further, Timken plans to cut carbon emissions per unit of revenue, which would allow it to generate more emissions if it earns more revenue. Because of that, its overall emissions reduction may be as little as 7% by 2030 or, worse, even increase.</p>
<p>“We’re looking for Timken to move from a laggard to a leadership position on climate and the clean energy transition,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “We appreciate the investors who stood with us in asking the company to accelerate and expand its efforts to cut its carbon footprint ,and we invite more to keep the pressure on Timken.”</p>
<p><strong>Timken Flirting with Climate and Reputational Risk</strong></p>
<p>Timken, headquartered in Cleveland, manufactures tapered bearings made out of steel. Its products are used by many industries including food and beverage, marine vessels, mining, agriculture, construction, commercial vehicles, and renewable energy systems. As of 2023, the company employed more than 19,000 people in 45 countries.</p>
<p>Timken has been recognized as one of <a href="https://news.timken.com/2024-04-16-Timken-Recognized-by-Fortune-as-one-of-Americas-Most-Innovative-Companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America&#8217;s Most Responsible Companies</a> by Newsweek, the World&#8217;s Most Ethical Companies® by Ethisphere, America&#8217;s Most Innovative Companies by Fortune and America&#8217;s Best Large Employers by Forbes.</p>
<p>Despite receiving multiple accolades, Timken is not fully addressing how its business contributes to climate change, which may hurt future profitability and make the company less attractive to investors. Companies with global operations and supply chains, like Timken, are <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerable to a variety of climate impacts</a> ranging from droughts and floods to hurricanes. Therefore, we believe concerted efforts to achieve economy-wide emissions reductions are paramount.</p>
<p>Timken is a supplier to the wind and solar industry, which comprised over 9% of its sales in 2023. Many companies across industry sectors are scrutinizing the sustainability of their supply chains, and renewable energy developers are sensitive about sourcing from suppliers that aren’t reducing their carbon footprints. If Timken does not take steps to reduce its climate emissions, it may incur reputational damage as its clients and investors may call out its refusal to adopt meaningful emissions reduction targets.</p>
<p>“Nearly <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8,000 companies</a> have now set or committed to set emissions reduction targets through the Science Based Targets initiative, which supports the goals of the Paris agreement,” commented Andrea Ranger, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “By holding back, Timken is creating risk for investors, especially when bold climate action is required.”</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">NXP has already established ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint.

<p>To head off catastrophic warming, the head of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has urged nations to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-chief-urges-faster-shift-net-zero-after-report-highlights-climate-threat-2023-03-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“slash emissions”</a> and business leaders to set <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/davos-2023-un-chief-urges-credible-net-zero-pledges-or-risk-greenwashing-2023-01-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets</a>.  “If we act now, we can still <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2023/03/20/press-release-ar6-synthesis-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure a livable sustainable future</a> for all,” asserted another United Nations climate expert.</p>
<p>Green Century° presses companies to set goals to <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/annie-sanders-why-we-work-on-certain-issues-our-priorities-for-fy24/">drastically cut their emissions</a>. But we know that goals are not enough. Green Century holds companies accountable by asking them to develop and publish climate transition plans. If such a plan sounds like something only scientists would read, try this analogy.</p>
<h3>What is a Climate Transition Plan?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_19285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19285" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-19285 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CTP-graphic-300x251.png" alt="" width="300" height="251" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19285" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Photographer Name on Image Source</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Imagine your daughter (who represents a company in this example) announces that she’s going on a cross-country road trip to San Francisco with her friends. Naturally, you (the investor) are immediately flooded with questions: Which route will you take? Where will you stop along the way? How are you going to pay for this trip? What if you run into unforeseen problems like storms or a flat tire?  How often will you stay in touch?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For her to reach her destination, you want to know that she has mapped out a route, saved money for the trip, has overnight lodging and has plans to communicate with you on a regular basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the corporate world, that’s what a climate transition plan does. It fills in the gap between where a company starts its journey and how it plans to get to its destination.</p>
<p><strong>Intel’s* First Climate Transition Plan</strong></p>
<p>In a real-world example, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel Corp</a>., the famous computer chip maker, had set goals to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from its business operations to be net-zero by 2040. This means it committed to cut its emissions significantly by 2040 and has pledged to work with its suppliers to reduce their emissions by 30% by 2030.</p>
<p>Green Century noticed that Intel had not developed a climate transition plan and worried that the chip manufacturer’s goals might not be fully credible without one. We filed a shareholder resolution in 2022 with the company, and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-successfully-secures-commitments-with-five-semiconductor-companies-to-create-climate-transition-plans/">it agreed to publish a climate transition</a> within six months. As soon as it was released, Intel contacted Green Century to share its <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/2023-11/climate-transition-action-plan-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaugural plan.</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19282 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/andreas-gucklhorn-Ilpf2eUPpUE-unsplash-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Intel&#8217;s plans include requesting suppliers set 100% renewable electricity and develop project roadmaps to achieve their goals, implement energy conservation projects, build new green factories and facilities, and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases used to manufacture its computer chips. Their deadline is 2030.</p>
<p>Green Century is pleased with Intel’s first plan, which creates a solid foundation from which to build more detailed plans in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the urgency of limiting the impacts of climate change, Green Century will continue to work with our portfolio companies to make the dramatic emissions reductions needed to protect the planet and ourselves. The work will be hard, but preparing a solid climate transition plan provides investors assurance that companies intend to do the necessary hard things.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Applied is tackling its climate impact on many fronts, and we’re really pleased that it’s so proactive,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “In the future, we hope  Applied is transparent about its plan to achieve its ambitious goals.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life as a shareholder advocate can be unpredictable – some of my work has a consistent flow, but I certainly wasn’t expecting an impromptu call from a CEO.</p>
<p>Green Century<em>°</em> shareholder advocates often use the stakes in different companies on behalf of Green Century Funds, as a way of influencing management decisions on deforestation, carbon emissions, climate change, single-use plastic reductions and other issues with environmental impacts. I work on our insurance campaign pressing insurance companies to stop offering coverage for new fossil fuel projects. Not surprisingly, these insurers are not interested in changing their insurance strategies.</p>
<p>During the year, shareholder advocates research the environmental risks that companies are exposed to or, worse yet, they create. And, we then communicate with companies by writing, calls, and face-to-face dialogue. When we can’t agree on a course of action, we present our concerns to fellow shareholders at companies’ annual meetings.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the Travelers’* annual meeting in Hartford, CT. After I presented Green Century’s Funds’ shareholder proposal, I went on a treasure hunt to meet the company’s board of directors and CEO, Alan Schnitzer. Security guards were blocking my path to the board, but I managed to meet three directors. I was thrilled.</p>
<p>I also asked to speak to Travelers’ CEO Alan Schnitzer, but he was busy. Then something special happened. As I reached my car to go home, Alan Schnitzer called me. I was sure it was a prank. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>We exchanged pleasantries, but the conversation steered toward Green Century Funds’ shareholder proposal. He wasn’t happy with it. We had to agree to disagree on whether insuring new fossil fuel projects was the right thing to do. Spoiler alert – I didn’t think it was. I still don’t.</p>
<p>A call from a CEO is a rare occurrence, and it signaled to me that Green Century Funds’ advocacy efforts were hitting their mark. However, I give a lot of credit to Travelers’ CEO for taking the time to call and listen to my concerns.</p>
<p>Being tenacious, and professionally polite, can pay big dividends. Further, the effort to meet board members helped humanize the relationship between Green Century Funds and Travelers. I’ll meet with Travelers again later this year, but now we have a stronger rapport.</p>
<p>It’s a privilege to be a shareholder advocate working on the toughest environmental challenges the world faces. Encounters with CEOs can result in better connections with corporate management. We always look for ways to collaborate, so we welcome phone calls from CEOs. Let’s work on solutions together.</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>
<p>Warmly, Andrea</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 2, 2023</strong> &#8211; Shareholders have weighed in on a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century° and the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asking McDonald’s to establish a more ambitious policy to eliminate use of medically important antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains. McDonald’s published the vote tally on Thursday which showed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390823000059/mcd-20230525.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.6% of votes cast</a> were in favor of the proposal.</p>
<p>In its opposition statement, McDonald’s acknowledges that antimicrobial resistance “is a critical global public health issue that we believe we and our suppliers have a responsibility to help address.” The term antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often used interchangeably with antibiotic resistance, but can also describe non-bacterial resistant diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies antimicrobial resistance as a global public health crisis that threatens to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0712-Antimicrobial-Resistance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse medical progress</a>, and the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies antimicrobial resistance as “one of the top <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 global public health threats</a> facing humanity.”</p>
<p>Although McDonald’s first publicized that it would address antibiotic resistance in its food animal supply chain in 2003, it didn’t set reduction targets until 2017, which were narrowly focused on its chicken supply chain. Further, the targets aimed to eliminate only the antibiotics that are highly critical to medicine, failing to protect a wide range of other important antibiotics that humans use to fight infections.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment/">proposal</a> filed by Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters asked McDonald’s to establish a policy that would not only eliminate routine use of all medically important human antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains, but push the company to establish timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, and guidelines for enforcement should suppliers fail to meet McDonald’s targets.</p>
<p>In December 2022, McDonald’s did <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> reduction, but not elimination, targets that are limited to its beef supply chain in its top 10 markets.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said:</strong></p>
<p>“McDonald’s shareholders have signaled that they want to hold McDonald’s responsible for not living up to its commitments, especially when it comes to animal welfare and protecting human health. We’ll continue to work with the company, but we won’t be satisfied until it takes steps necessary to protect the effectiveness of antibiotics, which are crucial to public health. We’re looking for both action and accountability on its part.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, Green Century Shareholder Advocate, stated:   </strong></p>
<p>“McDonald’s is the largest fast food restaurant in the world. As such, it has the influence to change the way food animals are raised and has the responsibility to protect public health from malicious germs which include dangerous bacteria. When I bite into a Big Mac, I want to know that the beef was sourced responsibly and that it was raised without using antibiotics that I, and society in general, need to stay healthy and whole.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 19, 2023</strong> – – Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc., a food company known for its popular snack brands, such as Chips Ahoy!, Cadbury, Ritz, and Oreo, were reluctant to support a Green Century° <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000130817923000589/lmdlz2023_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a>, as evidenced by the vote tally released on Friday. The proposal, which asks Mondelēz to disclose interim targets for achieving its goal to source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025, captured <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000110398223000025/mdlz-20230517.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.8% of the total vote</a>.</p>
<p>Demand for cage-free eggs, and the supply to match it, has grown dramatically in the U.S. and European Union in recent years –driven by consumer awareness of and desire for humanely-raised animal proteins as well as government pressure on manufacturers to switch to producing cage-free eggs. The term “cage-free” was coined in response to farmers’ use of “battery cages,” where hens are housed in spaces that are smaller than the size of a piece of printer paper.</p>
<p>Mondelēz first announced in 2016 that it would source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025. However, recent company disclosures of current sourcing volumes indicate that it is unlikely to meet its goal, which prompted the Green Century proposal. In recent years, excluding its Russian and Ukrainian egg markets, Mondelēz sourced cage-free eggs at a rate of 27% in 2020, 39% in 2021, and 43% in 2022. Extrapolating from its current progress, Mondelēz would achieve a sourcing rate of only 59% by the end of 2025, far short of its original ambition.</p>
<p>However, Mondelēz peers, General Mills and Conagra, disclose their planned progressions toward their global cage-free egg targets and are further along in achieving their goals than Mondelēz. Further, Target and a wide range of quick service food retailers including Jack in the Box, Denny’s, Bloomin’ Brands (the parent of Olive Garden) have also disclosed similar cage-free egg glide paths to their shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> responded to the vote result by saying: </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>“While we had hoped for greater support for our proposal, this is the first year we’ve brought this issue of cage-free egg goals to Mondelēz shareholders for a vote. Without publishing a clear path for achieving its 2050 cage-free egg sourcing goal, Mondelēz may be inviting unnecessary risk by being seen as not living up to its obligations. This is especially true because we’re talking about a sensitive animal welfare issue that has quite a bit of public support.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Disclosure is central to investor decision making, but Mondelēz has told us that disclosing interim targets for its 100% cage-free egg by 2050 goal would be “burdensome, unnecessary…. and could generate confusion among our stakeholders.” Given that it’s now 2023 and Mondelēz committed to reach its goal in 2025, one has to ask, does it really have a plan? If so, why wouldn’t it share it with investors?  For the sake of its investors, customers, and the health of the animals in its supply chain, I hope it does and it will.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 26, 2023</strong> – – Shareholders showed less support for a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">Green Century° proposal</a> that asked Travelers to establish a deadline for phasing out underwriting new fossil fuel projects. Votes cast in favor reached <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000086312/000110465923064998/tm2316995d1_8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.8%</a>, less than the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/votes-on-green-century-proposal-at-travelers-concludes-series-of-filings-at-major-insurers/">2022 vote outcome of 13.2%</a> for a similar Green Century proposal. Green Century filed the same proposal seeking underwriting restrictions on fossil fuel projects at a peer company, The Hartford*, earning 8.8% of the vote on May 17th.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals were prompted by concerns that Travelers’ underwriting strategies were not clearly aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Global climate and energy experts at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  and the International Energy Agency (IEA) assert that expanding fossil fuel supply will likely push the world beyond the recommended limit of a 1.5°C temperature rise. The IPCC reports explicitly that exceeding the 1.5°C limit will likely result in dangerous physical risks, and, in some cases, irreversible natural resource damage.</p>
<p>While U.S. insurers, <a href="https://about.chubb.com/citizenship/environment/coal-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chubb*</a> and <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2019/The-Hartford-Announces-Its-Policy-On-Insuring-Investing-In-Coal-Tar-Sands/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hartford</a>, announced partial underwriting exclusions on insuring thermal coal mining and coal plant construction and operation in 2019, it took Travelers an extra two years to make a <a href="https://sustainability.travelers.com/iw-documents/sustainability/coal-tar-sands-policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar commitment</a>. Additionally, it has yet to extend its exclusions to contractors, equipment or projects that support the development of new oil and gas wells, pipelines, and related fossil fuel infrastructure, even as  climate experts declare the use of fossil fuels must dramatically decline.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said: </strong></p>
<p>“Regardless of the vote, it&#8217;s important to keep this issue front and center for Travelers. We see no reason why it should enable new oil and gas supply in the face of the dire need to transition to a low-carbon economy.  To its credit, Travelers has already started down the right path by underwriting new renewable energy projects, including offshore wind construction. However, it still needs to detour from the path of insuring the expansion of fossil fuels.”</p>

<p>“Covering the liability and casualty risks for owners, contractors, and equipment that will allow new methane gas, a.ka. “natural” gas, to flow or new oil for gasoline will only lock us into carbon emissions for years to come. In my view, Travelers has a duty not only to its shareholders, but to stakeholders in general, to pivot from an industry that’s contributed the most to climate change.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2023</strong> – The Hartford announced the vote results on Friday for a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">Green Century° proposal</a> asking the company to establish a deadline for phasing out underwriting new fossil fuel projects. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/874766/000087476623000076/hig-20230517.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Votes cast in favor reached 8.8%</a>, the same as the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb/">2022 vote outcome of 8.8%</a> for a similar Green Century proposal. Green Century filed the same proposal seeking underwriting restrictions on fossil fuel projects at peer company, Travelers, whose annual meeting of shareholders will be held on May 24th.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals were prompted by reports authored by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  and the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicating how expanding fossil fuel supply is likely to push the world beyond the recommended limit of a 1.5°C temperature rise. The IPCC explicitly reports that exceeding the 1.5°C limit will likely result in dangerous physical risks, and, in some cases, irreversible natural resource damage.</p>
<p>While The Hartford did adopt partial underwriting exclusions for insuring thermal coal mining, coal plant construction and operation, and tar sands-related risks in 2019, it hasn’t extended its exclusions beyond the most heavily-polluting fuels &#8211; even when  climate experts say use of fossil fuels must dramatically decline. In 2022, the company adopted a goal to reach <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2022/The-Hartford-Announces-Goal-Of-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-For-All-Operations-By-2050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net-zero emissions by 2050</a>, but has yet to launch new initiatives in support of its goal.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said: </strong></p>
<p>“Regardless of the vote outcome, Green Century will continue to press The Hartford to fully address its climate risk. Despite its existing exclusions and its net-zero by 2050 goal, we’d like to see The Hartford extend its underwriting exclusions to other dirty fossil fuels, including new oil and gas projects. Insurance companies have a critical role to play in steering us toward a low-carbon economy, but supporting new oil and gas wells, pipelines, and transportation infrastructure will likely lock us into carbon emissions that we simply can’t afford.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Covering the liability and casualty risks of new oil and gas projects is antithetical to protecting the rest of The Hartford’s clients from climate risk. In light of the company’s net-zero goal, I believe Green Century Funds’ proposal is a reasonable request to phase out underwriting new risks for an industry that’s contributed the most to climate change.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 15, 2023</strong> – Green Century’s° <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">shareholder proposals</a> filed with The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and The Travelers Companies, Inc. are going to a vote at the companies’ annual general meetings on May 17<sup>th</sup> and May 24<sup>th</sup>, respectively. Green Century filed the proposals in December requesting that the companies phase out underwriting new fossil fuel projects in line with the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit global warming to 1.5℃ over pre-industrial temperatures.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals raise concerns that <a href="https://www.thehartford.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hartford</a> and <a href="https://www.travelers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travelers</a> are exposed to climate risk. Both companies underwrite policies meant to protect customers’ homes and businesses from the impacts of climate-driven catastrophes while simultaneously underwriting policies for the fossil fuel industry, whose emissions amplify the effects of those catastrophes.</p>
<p>“Insurers seem to think developing more gas and oil will somehow ease us into a clean energy transition, but developing new wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure is fundamentally incompatible with protecting people and the planet,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “Insurance should be about protection, not enabling systemic threats like climate change.”</p>
<p><strong>Net-zero goals and insuring new renewables projects are not enough</strong></p>
<p>While both The Hartford and Travelers have adopted partial underwriting exclusions on insuring thermal coal mining, coal plant construction and operation, and tar sands-related risks, neither company has agreed to limit underwriting new oil and gas projects, even in ecologically-sensitive areas like the Arctic. U.S. insurer Chubb*, the largest publicly-traded commercial property and casualty insurer in the world, <a href="https://news.chubb.com/2023-03-22-Chubb-Announces-New-Climate-and-Conservation-Focused-Underwriting-Standards-for-Oil-and-Gas-Extraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March that it will no longer underwrite oil and gas extraction projects in government-protected conservation areas and that it will press existing clients to cut methane leaks and emissions from flaring.</p>
<p>Although The Hartford set a <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2022/The-Hartford-Announces-Goal-Of-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-For-All-Operations-By-2050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal</a> to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across its full range of operations, the company has not announced plans to address how its underwriting strategies support its net-zero commitment. Travelers has neither set a net-zero goal nor has it addressed the incongruency of insuring fossil fuel development with protecting its customers from severe weather enhanced by a warming climate.</p>
<p>“Both The Hartford and Travelers are insuring new renewable energy projects, and we applaud that,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “But developing more renewables is only half the answer. Climate experts tell us that the other half is giving up extracting and burning even more oil and gas. For an industry that relies on science, I hope insurers will extract new oil and gas projects from their underwriting portfolios.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>
