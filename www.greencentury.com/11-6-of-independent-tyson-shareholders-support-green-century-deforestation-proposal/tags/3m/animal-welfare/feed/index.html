<p></p>



<p>Boston, April 18, 2025 – Fast food chain, Jack in the Box*, which has more than 2,000 locations across the United States, successfully met its interim target to source <a href="https://investors.jackinthebox.com/corporate-responsibility/Housing---Sows/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25%</a> of its pork from pigs raised in so-called “open pen gestation environments” rather than gestation crates, at the end of 2024. This benchmark, up from 0% at the end of 2023, is an important step toward the company’s goal to source 100% of its pork that way by 2026 as outlined in an agreement with Green Century° in 2023.</p>



<p><br>The use of gestation crates, which confine pregnant sows for weeks or months at a time, is controversial because it harms animals and can damage the reputations of companies with their customers. Gestation crates are so small that they don’t allow pregnant pigs to turn around. They <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/pig-gestation-crates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harm the animals</a> and are considered inhumane. The open pen gestation environments that Jack in the Box is transitioning to provide pigs with enhanced social opportunities, more freedom and space to move, and have been shown to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8300341/#:~:text=Simple%20Summary,sows%20in%20modern%20pig%20production" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve their health and welfare</a>.</p>



<p><br>“We are enthusiastic to see Jack in the Box’s progress on this issue that is of increasing customer and  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-05/animal-welfare-is-on-more-proxy-ballots-two-years-after-icahn-s-fight?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor concern</a>. Poor animal welfare practices in corporate supply chains present reputational risks for companies,” <strong>said <strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a></strong></strong>, <strong>president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “The company’s commitment has raised animal welfare standards and helps establish a common practice among quick service restaurants around the U.S.”</p>



<p><br>According to a 2021 survey, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/majority-of-regular-pork-buying-americans-show-concern-for-pig-welfare-hold-retailers-responsible-to-end-what-are-seen-by-many-as-objectionable-practices-a-new-harris-poll-reports-301206549.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">66% of Americans think that gestation crates are unacceptable</a>. <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2023/april/farm-animal-welfare-policies-cover-breeding-sows-veal-calves-or-laying-hens-in-14-u-s-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ten U.S. states</a> have passed laws restricting the use of gestation crates. The UK has banned their usage and the EU only allows them for the first four weeks of a sow’s pregnancy.</p>



<p><br>With its progress, Jack in the Box is catching up to its fast-food peers. Wendy’s completed its transition away from gestation crates <a href="https://www.wendys.com/csr-what-we-value/food/responsible-sourcing/pork/gestation-stall-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2022</a>, and <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/animal-health-and-welfare.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McDonald’s</a> and <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/317237604/files/doc_downloads/2024/08/2023-Restaurant-Brands-for-Good.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Burger King</a>, both of which committed to phase out crates by 2024, were on track to do so as of their most recent updates. </p>



<p></p>



<p>Green Century will continue to maintain dialogue with Jack in the Box as the chain progresses toward its 2026 commitment.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, September 20, 2024</strong> – A proposal filed by Green Century° asking Darden Restaurants, Inc.* to eliminate the use of gestation crates received 19.3% of the votes cast at the company’s annual meeting on Sept. 18. The use of gestation crates, which confine pregnant sows for weeks or months at a time, is widely considered inhumane due to the physical and psychological suffering they cause the animals.</p>



<p>“Gestation crates present both ethical and reputational concerns for companies,” said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. “We hope Darden will take investor support for this proposal seriously and phase out gestation creates as soon as possible.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/105481/eib-245.pdf?v=8189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleven states</a> ban or restrict gestation crates, which confine pregnant sows in spaces that are roughly 2-by-7 feet – areas so small that they can’t even turn around. Group housed pork, by contrast, has breeding pigs kept together for a majority of each pregnancy cycle.</p>



<p><strong>Darden Out of Step with Industry Peers</strong></p>



<p>Darden is out of step with others in the industry by maintaining its reliance on gestation crates. In 2023, Darden competitor Bloomin’ Brands* announced a goal for reaching 90% group-housed pork globally by <a href="https://www.bloominbrands.com/our-commitment/our-ingredients" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2029</a>. Many other companies in the food industry have made progress on sourcing pork from suppliers that have reduced or eliminated gestation crates. Companies such as Kroger*, Costco*, Target*, McDonald’s* and Wendy’s* have already shifted or are in the process of shifting to group-housed pork.</p>



<p>From 2016–2022, Darden publicized a commitment to source gestation crate-free pork by 2025, but without providing any progress updates. In 2022, a shareholder proposal asked Darden to finally provide one. In exchange for a withdrawal of that proposal, Darden published a statement admitting that it would not achieve its 2025 target but promised to “provide an updated timeline by the end of FY2023” for converting to group housed pork. Yet, that deadline came without Darden publishing any such timeline.</p>



<p>“Despite promising shareholders for many years that it would eliminate gestation crates, Darden still lacks a timeline for phasing them out,” said Annie Sanders, Green Century’s Director of Shareholder Advocacy. “It’s time for Darden to finally meet the standards of its competitors, investors and consumers by setting a target to drop gestation crates.”</p>

					<h2>Classic Hostess brands agree to use cage-free eggs after Green Century engagement.</h2>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(BOSTON)</strong> J. M. Smucker Co* announced that its Hostess brand, which includes iconic snack products like Twinkies, Snowballs and CupCakes, will be switching completely to direct purchases of cage-free eggs by 2028. J. M. Smucker achieved a 100% cage-free egg supply before acquiring the Hostess brand in 2023. Hostess previously did not use cage-free eggs.</p>
<p>J. M. Smucker Co made the commitment after signing an agreement with Green Century.</p>
<p>“Bringing cage-free eggs to an iconic American brand like Hostess means happier hens and healthier snacks,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We admire Smucker’s commitment, proving that big brands play a key role in building a more ethical food industry.”</p>
<p>Smucker’s provided a glidepath towards reaching its cage-free egg goal and will transparently report on its progress annually in its sustainability report.</p>
<h3>Green Century’s advocacy promotes animal welfare</h3>
<p>Green Century has taken a leading role in promoting animal welfare at major brands advocating for healthy and humane conditions for animals. Carl Icahn nominated Samuelrich in 2022 for the board of McDonald’s after the company backed away from its gestation crate-free pork pledge. Green Century also recently filed a shareholder resolution at Darden, parent company of Olive Garden, asking the company to commit to removing gestation crates from its supply chain.</p>
<p>“Growing visibility into supply chains means that animal welfare can no longer be ‘out of sight, out of mind’,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate</strong>. “Consumers will continue to learn about &#8211; and demand &#8211; better treatment for animals in agriculture.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, April 23, 2024 </strong>– Following the submission of a Green Century° shareholder proposal, Domino’s Pizza* <a href="https://biz.dominos.com/stewardship/responsible-sourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its opposition to  the confinement of breeding pigs in gestation crates and supports housing them in open groups instead.</p>
<p>“The Company supports the humane treatment of animals and will continue to exert the influence we have with the U.S. pork industry to maximize the time that pregnant sows spend in group housing, away from gestation crates,” said Domino’s in its new statement. “The Company commends efforts to eliminate gestation crate usage in the restaurant industry.”</p>
<p>The use of gestation crates, which confine pregnant sows for weeks or months at a time, is controversial because they harm animals and can damage the reputations of companies with their customers.</p>
<p>As an example, McDonald’s* failure to fully implement its gestation crate-free pork pledge prompted a challenge to the company’s board in 2022. Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich ran for the board in a campaign that elevated the issue through media attention including in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/business/dealbook/mcdonalds-pork-carl-icahn.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/icahn-nominates-two-to-mcdonalds-board-sources-say-11645390277" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-22/mcdonald-s-faces-fight-from-activist-carl-icahn-over-fight-for-animal-rights?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>“There has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-05/animal-welfare-is-on-more-proxy-ballots-two-years-after-icahn-s-fight?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing investor concern</a> about poor animal welfare practices in corporate supply chains,” said  Samuelrich. “While we’re glad to see that Domino’s now supports group sow housing and has taken some measures to increase use within its supply chain, we encourage it to set measurable targets for achieving that goal.”</p>
<p>Domino’s competitor Yum! Brands, owner of Pizza Hut, recently <a href="https://www.yum.com/wps/portal/yumbrands/Yumbrands/citizenship-and-sustainability/food/animal-welfare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it will be “working to establish measurable targets for moving to group housing and begin to externally report our findings on sow housing.”</p>
<p>“Confinement cages present both ethical and reputational concerns for companies involved in their use,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “We hope that Domino’s and other competitors, like Papa John’s, will follow Pizza Hut’s lead in working to establish targets for shifting pork procurement away from gestation crates.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green Century Funds° helps investors make an impact for the planet through a sustainable investing strategy, partners with its investment advisor in an award-winning shareholder advocacy program, and a unique ownership model that sends 100% of our net profits to support the environmental campaign work of our nonprofit owners.</p>
<p>One question we often get is, “How do you decide what issues to work on”?</p>
<p>This is an excellent question. There’s no shortage of issues facing our environment, and it can be hard to decide where to start making a difference. The good news is that while our planet may have more problems than it deserves, we’re finding more solutions every day to help fix them.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17905" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="177" /></p>
<p>Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. Shareholder advocacy is a tool used by investors to push a company to report on or change a policy. Green Century negotiates with companies to improve their sustainability practices by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, protecting ocean wildlife from plastic pollution, adopting sustainable agriculture policies and more. Then, once companies make commitments, we assess their progress and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>To choose our priority issues, we evaluate a number of factors. First, we’re Green Century Funds for a reason – we’re all about protecting the environment. So, our first consideration is, how can we make the biggest impact for the planet? These issues run the gamut from stopping global warming, protecting endangered species, preserving forests or reducing plastic waste. We evaluate today’s most pressing issues which, if we can win concrete changes to corporate policy, will produce the most profound benefits for ecosystems around the world?</p>
<p>Then, we think about our comparative advantage. Where can we uniquely advance change? Where does our expertise lie? What emerging frameworks and targets can companies implement to mitigate environmental risks? On which issues can we make the strongest business case for action?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19274 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/raze-solar-pIcseKMisrs-unsplash-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p>At the end of the day, there’s no one issue that merits all of our attention; the threats facing our planet are multifaceted and ever evolving. But one thing we do know is that to ensure we have a planet to operate businesses on in the future, companies need to figure out now how to give back more than they take. And since nature is everybody&#8217;s business, there&#8217;s no company that can stand on the sidelines.</p>
<p>This coming shareholder season, which runs on a schedule similar to a school year, we’re focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting forests around the world by convincing food and consumer goods companies to protect biodiversity by addressing their nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, as well as by establishing science-based targets for nature that will protect our planet for generations to come.</li>
<li>Reducing plastic pollution by pressing companies to use less plastic in their packaging, especially new plastic, and to scale up reuse models that will help drive a circular economy.</li>
<li>Asking companies that have set goals to reduce their contribution to climate change to develop climate transition plans that chart how the company will hit their targets and move toward a clean energy economy.</li>
<li>Expanding the number of companies with Right to Repair policies that help consumers and reduce dangerous electronic waste.</li>
<li>Pressing insurance companies – which, ironically, are pulling coverage from areas prone to natural disasters exacerbated by extreme weather – to stop underwriting the new fossil fuel projects driving extreme weather in the first place.</li>
<li>Protecting animal welfare by asking companies to institute more humane policies such as eliminating gestation crates.</li>
<li>Pushing major retailers to phase out gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric lawn equipment to improve air quality and cut off another key contributor to climate change.<br />
A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19277 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/appolinary-kalashnikova-WYGhTLym344-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>These are just some of the solutions we’ll be advancing this coming year to help build a cleaner, greener future today and for future generations. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.</p>
<p>Thank you for your investment in Green Century Funds, which makes our shareholder advocacy work possible.</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 19, 2023</strong> – – Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc., a food company known for its popular snack brands, such as Chips Ahoy!, Cadbury, Ritz, and Oreo, were reluctant to support a Green Century° <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000130817923000589/lmdlz2023_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a>, as evidenced by the vote tally released on Friday. The proposal, which asks Mondelēz to disclose interim targets for achieving its goal to source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025, captured <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000110398223000025/mdlz-20230517.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.8% of the total vote</a>.</p>
<p>Demand for cage-free eggs, and the supply to match it, has grown dramatically in the U.S. and European Union in recent years –driven by consumer awareness of and desire for humanely-raised animal proteins as well as government pressure on manufacturers to switch to producing cage-free eggs. The term “cage-free” was coined in response to farmers’ use of “battery cages,” where hens are housed in spaces that are smaller than the size of a piece of printer paper.</p>
<p>Mondelēz first announced in 2016 that it would source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025. However, recent company disclosures of current sourcing volumes indicate that it is unlikely to meet its goal, which prompted the Green Century proposal. In recent years, excluding its Russian and Ukrainian egg markets, Mondelēz sourced cage-free eggs at a rate of 27% in 2020, 39% in 2021, and 43% in 2022. Extrapolating from its current progress, Mondelēz would achieve a sourcing rate of only 59% by the end of 2025, far short of its original ambition.</p>
<p>However, Mondelēz peers, General Mills and Conagra, disclose their planned progressions toward their global cage-free egg targets and are further along in achieving their goals than Mondelēz. Further, Target and a wide range of quick service food retailers including Jack in the Box, Denny’s, Bloomin’ Brands (the parent of Olive Garden) have also disclosed similar cage-free egg glide paths to their shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> responded to the vote result by saying: </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>“While we had hoped for greater support for our proposal, this is the first year we’ve brought this issue of cage-free egg goals to Mondelēz shareholders for a vote. Without publishing a clear path for achieving its 2050 cage-free egg sourcing goal, Mondelēz may be inviting unnecessary risk by being seen as not living up to its obligations. This is especially true because we’re talking about a sensitive animal welfare issue that has quite a bit of public support.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Disclosure is central to investor decision making, but Mondelēz has told us that disclosing interim targets for its 100% cage-free egg by 2050 goal would be “burdensome, unnecessary…. and could generate confusion among our stakeholders.” Given that it’s now 2023 and Mondelēz committed to reach its goal in 2025, one has to ask, does it really have a plan? If so, why wouldn’t it share it with investors?  For the sake of its investors, customers, and the health of the animals in its supply chain, I hope it does and it will.”</p>
