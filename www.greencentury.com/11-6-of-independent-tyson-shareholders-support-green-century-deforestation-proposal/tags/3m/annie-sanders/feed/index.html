					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495; Annie Sanders, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 14, 2024</strong> – A noteworthy 11.6% of independent Tyson Foods* shareholders voted in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal urging the company to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains by 2025. Independent shareholders include all shares that are not held by Tyson Limited Partnership or Tyson’s directors or executive officers.</p>
<p>“Independent shareholders have sent a strong message that Tyson can’t put deforestation on the back burner,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. “Tyson should step up to the plate and make sure its meat doesn’t come with a side of forest destruction.”</p>
<p>The pace of deforestation broke records in 2023 in the Brazilian Cerrado, the world&#8217;s most biologically rich savanna, surging by nearly 45% since 2022. To produce its extensive line of meat products, Tyson Foods buys ingredients from countries around the world, including from high-risk regions such as Brazil where cattle ranching is the largest driver of <a href="https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/brasil/tnc-execs-environmentalframeworkcattle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Tyson’s Deforestation Goals Fall Short</strong></span></p>
<p>Tyson aims to achieve a deforestation-free beef supply chain by the end of 2028 and to eliminate deforestation in its soy and palm oil supply chains by 2030. These goals fall 3-5 years short of recommendations from standard-setting bodies that have concluded that companies can’t hit their climate targets without eliminating deforestation by <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors/forest-land-and-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025</a>.</p>
<p>Tyson also lags peers including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-hormel-foods-commits-to-no-deforestation-by-2025/">Hormel Foods</a>* and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/processed-food-giant-conagra-to-eliminate-deforestation-from-its-supply-chains/">Conagra</a>*, both of which recently pledged to be deforestation-free by 2025.</p>
<p>“This vote demonstrates a growing understanding among investors that deforestation in Tyson’s supply chain exposes the company to material risks,” said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “We urge the company to take investor concern seriously and accelerate progress toward zero-deforestation.”</p>
<p>The Tyson family’s control of Class B shares means it holds up to 70% of the voting rights at the <a href="https://www.pionline.com/governance/new-york-state-common-challenges-tysons-dual-share-stock-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company</a>. The support from independent shareholders is approximate and was calculated under the assumption that Tyson insiders, Tyson Limited Partnership, Tyson’s directors, and executive officers voted against the proposal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Green Century has worked in recent years to push food, beverage and personal care brand companies to reduce their plastic packaging, develop more packaging reuse programs and introduce more transparent reporting of progress. We&#8217;ve recently engaged with companies including Coca Cola*, General Mills*, Sysco*, Colgate-Palmolive* and Keurig Dr. Pepper* on these issues.</em></p>
<p><em>Green Century&#8217;s Director of shareholder advocacy, Annie Sanders, spoke to Argus Media about Green Century&#8217;s motives and place in the industry, the changing of attitudes of investors towards companies that do not make meaningful progress and the risks involved, and Green Century&#8217;s prioritization of plastic avoidance over recycling as an environmental solution. Edited highlights follow: </em></p>
<h3>What role can investors such as Green Century Funds play in driving firms to act against plastic waste?</h3>
<p>I think that broadly all investors in companies where plastic waste is a feature of their production have a role to play. We can and must engage in dialogue with companies whose policies are lacking in the topic of plastic waste, or companies who are leaders and can really push the envelope, such as Colgate-Palmolive, where there is still progress to be made in the coming years, as the risks to investors [of insufficient action against plastic waste] will only multiply over time.</p>
<h3>What are those risks, as you see them?</h3>
<p>The key risks that are important to investors like us to consider are reputational risk, competitive risk and regulatory risk. From a reputational perspective, plastic remains higher than climate change as the top environmental concern among Americans, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s replicated elsewhere. From a competitive standpoint, many companies are now setting similar goals, including absolute plastic reduction targets in some cases. And retailers have been increasing the ambition of their plastic reduction goals for their own-brand products. Regulatory pressure is increasing. In the US, statewide extended producer responsibility laws have been passed in the past two years in California, Colorado, Oregon and Maine. There are recycled content requirements under discussion in Washington, Connecticut and New Jersey, as well as national legislation and even the UN&#8217;s global plastics treaty, as well as a lot more regulatory action in Europe.</p>
<h3>How have you seen the attitudes of companies and investors changing?</h3>
<p>We have definitely seen a growing recognition from companies and investors that plastic pollution is a financial, competitive and regulatory risk that companies need to develop a plan to address comprehensively, and that investors need information about companies&#8217; actions to mitigate relevant portfolio risks. We feel companies need to start reporting their progress on reducing total plastic, in their annual sustainability reports as well as [non-profit organization] CDP&#8217;s new plastics disclosure program. As the public and legislators express increasing levels of concern about global plastic pollution, [we estimate] that brand owners could face an annual financial risk of approximately $100bn, should governments require them to cover the waste management costs of the plastic packaging they produce. Not only do [shareholder&#8217;s] attitudes seem to be more in favor of plastics related proposals, but the votes [on shareholder proposals put forward by Green Century Funds] reflect that. We won majority votes at General Mills in September and Sysco in November, which I think reflects that investors recognize these risks and are interested in companies addressing them. Because of that, and because of more research and reports being published about the financial risks, companies and investors are starting to pay more attention.</p>
<h3>Your approach is focused on absolute plastic reduction and re-use, rather than recycling and recyclability. Does this indicate a mistrust in the effectiveness of the recycling industry?</h3>
<p>At this point there is overwhelming evidence that we cannot recycle our way out of the plastic crisis. Experts say that we need to reduce demand for plastic by one-third to take control of the problem. There are abundant reports that have emerged in recent years that underscore that we must reduce the amount of plastic that we are pumping into the waste stream and secondly re-use the plastic that we do create, and then finally look to increased recycling as a solution. Recycling is certainly a key part of the solution, but it should not be a go-to according to the research that has been done recently. As with any complex problem there is no simple solution. We focus our efforts on reduce and re-use. We certainly support governments looking to strengthen recycling infrastructure, but we see it as a last resort.</p>
<h3>As an investor, how cautious are you over the short-term costs of enacting more ambitious plastic targets, particularly in the current environment where rising costs have reduced sales volumes for some brand owners?</h3>
<p>Short-term costs are definitely something that we take into consideration and are concerned about, but we are long-term investors in these companies, so we also think about the longer-term systemic risks that we need to address now to ensure the viability of the company in the long term. We often ask companies to report if and how they can scale up the pace and rigor of their efforts, including all of the costs involved. But I do also think it can be challenging to quantify all of the externalities that plastic waste creates. Plastic waste and climate change are both systemic risks, and we have to think about the risks in a number of contexts, even down to examples like pollution of waterways when companies we invest in rely on clean water to conduct their operations. There is no way to fully balance the short-term risks, but we come down on the side that it&#8217;s worth companies doing the research and due diligence to figure out what they can do and need to do.</p>

<p><b>Boston, April 18, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keurig Dr. Pepper*, a leading global beverage company with brands from Snapple to 7Up, will boost efforts to cut single-use plastic by expanding its “reuse and refill” options across the country. In exchange for its heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction in total plastic packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of plastic flowing into our oceans is on pace to </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20plastic%20trash,to%2029%20million%20metric%20tons." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly triple by 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Keurig Dr. Pepper for stepping up its efforts to address the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keurig Dr. Pepper’s planned actions include expanding its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to include more details on refillable and reusable container pilots. Starting in 2023, the company pledged to publish an annual “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its CSR report. By 2024, the company plans to launch new reuse and refill pilots in key U.S. markets where the local infrastructure and culture are conducive to their success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Keurig Dr. Pepper help build a circular economy by providing more reuse options – from soda cups to K-Cup Pods – in communities across the U.S.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Companies such as Keurig Dr. Pepper are beginning to realize that an investment in reusable and refillable containers can mitigate the financial, regulatory, and reputational risks posed by single-use plastics,” added Sanders. “They’re also seeing consumers act, in growing numbers, on the common-sense conviction that nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our planet for hundreds of years.”</span></p>
