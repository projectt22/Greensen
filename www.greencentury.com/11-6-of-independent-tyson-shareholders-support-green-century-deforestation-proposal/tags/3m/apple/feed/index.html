					<p>(Boston, MA) &#8211; In a positive development for the Right to Repair movement, technology giant <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a>* announced it would expand its Self Service Repair program to its newest iPhone 14 and M2 Mac models. The company’s continued commitment is a win for consumer rights and efforts to combat e-waste and came after <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century Funds</a>°, a leading environmentally responsible family of mutual funds, advocated for increasing sustainable business practices at the company.</p>
<p>Green Century initiated discussions with Apple in 2021 and submitted a shareholder proposal later that year asking the company to consider the environmental and social benefits of making its devices more easily repairable by consumers and independent repair shops.</p>
<h2><strong>Green Century Advocacy Creates Long-Term Impact for the Environment </strong></h2>
<p>Through a series of collaborative meetings, Green Century provided Apple with compelling evidence on the positive environmental implications of allowing customers to repair instead of replacing their products. Repairs extend the life of products, help reduce electronic and plastic waste, promote a more circular economy, and aligns Apple’s policy on the issue with its own sustainability goals and commitments.</p>
<p>Green Century’s efforts helped to culminate in Apple announcing for the first time in 2021 that it would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products. Green Century withdrew its shareholder proposal in return for Apple’s commitments.</p>
<p>“True to its slogan, Apple is “Thinking Different” by helping to reduce electronic waste and helping customers hold on to their products longer. Green Century is proud to have played a role in Apple&#8217;s evolving support for Right to Repair and hope that their leadership moves its competitors to follow suit,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</p>
<p>Apple and other technology companies traditionally have lobbied against Right to Repair legislation, so the announcement of its expanded repair commitments carries substantial weight in industry discussions. Americans spend around <a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,700</a> per household a year purchasing new electronic devices, and nearly<a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 7 million tons</a> of American <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/what-is-e-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic e-waste</a> end up in landfills each year.</p>

<p>Media Contacts: Annalisa Tarizzo, atarizzo@greencentury.com, 781-349-2789</p>



<p><strong>Boston, April 27, 2022 – </strong>Apple officially <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apples-self-service-repair-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched </a>its long-awaited Self-Service Repair program Wednesday, five months after announcing the program at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787336/apple-right-to-repair-self-service-diy-reason-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompting </a>of a Green Century shareholder proposal. U.S.-based consumers can now access repair manuals and purchase more than 200 parts and tools for fixing iPhone 12, 13, and SE 3 models.</p>



<p>The announcement of the program was a reversal in course for Apple, which has historically opposed the Right to Repair. While there are promising aspects, particularly the free availability of repair manuals, investors have remaining concerns about how the program will be run and how Apple is still maintaining tight control over the repair of its products.</p>



<p>Unlike similar initiatives announced by Google and Samsung, Apple is requiring consumers to pair replacement parts to the serial number of the device being repaired. This will continue to make it difficult for independent repair shops to perform iPhone repairs and will pose challenges to refurbishers who want to repair phones after Apple stops officially supporting the model. As <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/59239/apples-self-repair-vision-is-here-and-its-got-a-catch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted </a>by repair organization iFixit, this “essentially puts an expiration date on iPhones.”</p>



<p><strong>Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century Capital Management,<em>°</em> released the following statement</strong>:</p>



<p>“The launch of Apple’s repair program today is a promising step forward for the company and should provide some comfort to investors that Apple is working to mitigate the regulatory risks posed by potential Right to Repair regulations from the Federal Trade Commission and state legislatures.</p>



<p>“However, this program does not sufficiently address our concerns related to the reputational and environmental risks posed by the electronic waste and greenhouse gas emissions associated with premature device disposal. Apple should take steps to eliminate the ‘parts pairing’ element of the program to ensure company devices can reach their full lifespan potential.”</p>
