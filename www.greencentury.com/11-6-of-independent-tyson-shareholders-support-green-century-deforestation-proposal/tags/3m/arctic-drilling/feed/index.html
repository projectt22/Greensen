<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, </span><a href="mailto:tpeterson@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asanders@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, </span><a href="mailto:mmorgenstein@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ppodger@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, April 24, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – In time to celebrate Earth Month, Green Century° withdrew a shareholder proposal asking ExxonMobil*, the </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/257417/top-10-oil-and-gas-companies-worldwide-based-on-revenue/#:~:text=ExxonMobil%20is%20the%20largest%20United,nearly%20307%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest oil and gas company in the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to refrain from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In its opposition statement to Green Century’s proposal, the company announced that it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has no plans for new oil and gas exploration or development in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, nor in the broader arctic region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has never been a good idea. Not only would it destroy habitat for polar bears and caribou, it’s just bad business,” said Green Century President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We’re glad ExxonMobil has acknowledged that reality and has no plans to drill in this pristine, national treasure.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Protect Arctic By Not Drilling for Oil and Gas</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar vein, Green Century filed proposals calling on oil and gas giant Chevron Corporation to renounce drilling in the Arctic in both 2020 and 2021. Not long after, Chevron, along with Hilcorp Energy Company, paid $10M to </span><a href="https://www.adn.com/business-economy/energy/2022/05/27/two-oil-companies-quietly-spent-10-million-to-exit-arctic-refuge-leases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terminate their leases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Arctic Refuge. Last year, President Biden </span><a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2022/05/30/oil-drilling-in-the-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-faces-long-odds-its-still-dividing-progressives-in-alaskas-us-house-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspended oil leases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> auctioned off under the Trump administration, and major banks and insurers are increasingly committing not to back oil projects in the Arctic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hard to imagine a viable business case for drilling in the Refuge at this point,” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Director of Shareholder Advocacy with Green Century. “It’s time for oil companies like ExxonMobil to commit to staying out of the Arctic Refuge for good – before irreparable damage is done to its fragile ecosystems, indigenous peoples’ sacred places, and our climate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the calving ground of the Porcupine caribou herd as well as more than 200 bird species and 42 species of fish and 45 mammal species, including four threatened ones that are protected under the </span><a href="https://defenders.org/sites/default/files/publications/Americas-Wild-Arctic-Worth-Protecting-Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endangered Species Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The prospect of drilling in the Arctic Refuge is wildly unpopular – </span><a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/americans-oppose-drilling-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than two-thirds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans oppose oil and gas development there.</span></p>

<p><strong>Media Contact:</strong> Thomas Peterson, <a href="mailto:tpeterson@greencentury.com">tpeterson@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2615; Josh Chetwynd, <a href="mailto:jchetwynd@greencentury.com">jchetwynd@greencentury.com</a>, 303-573-5558</p>



<p><strong>Boston, March 4, 2022</strong> – Green Century° has filed a shareholder proposal with Chevron, calling on the oil and gas company to commit to not pursuing petroleum exploration and development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>



<p>“Drilling in the Arctic Refuge would impact fragile ecosystems, threaten a sacred place for Indigenous people, and exacerbate climate-related risks,” said Thomas Peterson, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “Furthermore, potential financing for such projects is vanishing as many major American banks now refuse to finance oil and gas exploration in the Arctic Refuge. Major insurance companies like AIG* are also ruling out investing in or providing insurance cover for Arctic energy exploration. Chevron should similarly steer clear of any future projects in the refuge.”</p>



<p>Chevron, which has recently come under scrutiny for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/16/1081119920/greenwashing-oil-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failing to follow through on its climate pledges</a>, declared its support for drilling in the Arctic Refuge at its 2020 annual shareholder meeting. The company has demonstrated long-standing interest in the region, having partnered with BP* to complete the only test well ever drilled in the Arctic Refuge.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/news/">Green Century filed a similar shareholder proposal last year</a>, calling on the company to renounce drilling in the Arctic. Chevron refused. Instead, the company attempted to block its shareholders from considering the proposal. It petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow exclusion of Green Century’s proposal from its proxy statement.</p>



<p>Though Chevron did not bid at the initial Arctic Refuge lease sale last January, the Journal of Petroleum Technology noted in October 2021 that Chevron does not appear to be “leaving the scene anytime soon,” in reference to Alaska’s North Slope. Green Century is therefore once again calling on the company to make a commitment not to pursue drilling in the Arctic Refuge.</p>



<p>The Bureau of Land Management calculated that burning all the oil in the Arctic Refuge would release more than 4.3 gigatons of CO2e. That’s the equivalent of 94% of all U.S. emissions from energy consumption in 2020. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the calving ground of the Porcupine caribou herd as well as more than 200 bird species, 42 species of fish, and 45 mammals, including four threatened species that are protected under the Endangered Species Act. It is unsurprising then that the prospect of drilling in the Arctic Refuge is wildly unpopular – more than two-thirds of Americans oppose oil and gas development in this special place.</p>
