					<p><strong>Boston &#8211; </strong>Mattel, Inc.*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to report on its single-use plastic in packaging to the standardized reporting framework CDP in 2025 after reaching an agreement with <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century</a>°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>Mattel uses plastic packaging for its popular toy brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, and continues to develop ways to improve the sustainability of its packaging.</p>
<p>“We have tremendous respect for the team at Mattel and applaud the company’s commitment to transparency,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Accurate data is critical for decision making, and this new commitment will let investors look ‘into the box’ to view how Mattel is reducing plastic waste.”</p>
<p>Mattel and Green Century had previously reached a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/">deal</a> in which Mattel agreed to set a company-wide plastic reduction goal. Mattel fulfilled that agreement in 2022 by committing to reduce its plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030.</p>
<p>This additional commitment to disclose information on single-use plastic in packaging to CDP will help stakeholders better understand Mattel’s sustainable packaging efforts through a recognized, standardized reporting platform.</p>
<h3><strong>Mattel to join 3,000 global companies reporting to CDP Plastic</strong></h3>
<p>Standardized reporting is an essential first step in reducing plastic pollution.</p>
<p>“Right now, each company discloses plastic information in different ways, making it nearly impossible for governments, recyclers, and investors to really know what plastic is out there,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We really view CDP as the gold standard when it comes to voluntary disclosure.”</p>
<h3><strong>Plastic pollution continues explosive growth</strong></h3>
<p>The current plastic waste system has failed to keep plastic out of the ecosystem. Only <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/campaigns/beyond-plastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastic waste is recycled</a>, while plastic pollution has doubled every six years.</p>
<p>Plastic waste makes its way into waterways, killing marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, as plastic doesn’t break down like other materials, small particles of “<a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/updates/microplastics-in-100-of-the-co-waterways-we-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics</a>” have been found in every environment and even the human bloodstream.</p>
<p>The issue has increasingly alarmed consumers and investors. Over <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of respondents to a recent survey have asked companies to use less single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Companies’ efforts to improve sustainability of their products and packaging are an important aspect of helping to protect the planet for future generations.</p>
