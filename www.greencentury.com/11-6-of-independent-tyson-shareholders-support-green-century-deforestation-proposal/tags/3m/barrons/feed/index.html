<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="387" height="258" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-24051" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1.jpg 387w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alain_rieder?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alain Rieder</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/black-whale-W3uctt_p_os?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>9. Pressing tech companies to curb emissions.</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>While IBM* has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-31-of-ibm-shareholders-support-green-century-climate-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</a></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>7. Protecting rare natural spaces</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br><span style="font-size: 17.897px;">Chemours*: The Okefenokee is one of the largest freshwater wetlands in the world, a massive carbon sink, and home to over 1,000 species of plants and animals. In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Chemours &#8211; the DuPont chemical company spinoff &#8211; agreed in 2022 to not buy titanium sourced from mines adjacent to the Okefenokee. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/investors-call-on-chemours-to-stay-out-of-the-okefenokee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century continued to press Chemours in 2024 to make that commitment permanent.</a> </span></span></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. <span style="font-size: 17.897px;">Unwavering commitment to fossil fuel free funds</span></strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century</a> helped lead the fossil fuel free investing movement so individuals have the opportunity to invest without supporting the industry that has driven climate change.  Other mutual funds in the responsible investing space had followed Green Century’s lead but now are backtracking. You can count on Green Century to remain steadfast in its opposition to coal, oil, gas and other environmentally dangerous industries including nuclear power. </span></p>
