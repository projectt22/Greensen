<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 10.5% of McDonald’s* shareholders cast their votes in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to assess whether its existing climate policies and plans are sufficient to achieve its emissions reduction targets. The resolution, which went to the ballot Tuesday, requests details on McDonald’s progress toward reaching its net-zero emissions by 2050 goal</p>



<p>“McDonald’s commitment to reducing carbon pollution shows that the company understands the risks that a warming planet poses to its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Now, McDonald’s must assure investors that it will live up to its commitments and take the necessary steps to meaningfully reduce climate-related risks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef has an outsized climate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/food-systems-responsible-for-one-third-of-human-caused-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our food system</a> accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and few meals we eat contribute to those emissions more than a burger. The life cycle of beef from farm to fork<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emits more greenhouse gas emissions</a> per kilogram than any other food, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular fast-food restaurants can play a key role in addressing climate change by buying and selling beef produced with processes that reduce emissions. Chains including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have added alternative-protein patties to their menus. Diversifying protein options to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption of beef is one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical method to cutting climate emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>McDonald’s </strong><strong>is slow </strong><strong>to show progress&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s set short- and long-term targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with what science says is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Because beef makes up about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/the-carbon-footprint-of-mcdonald-s-menu-very-big" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of the company&#8217;s total climate footprint</a>, reducing beef-related emissions is an impactful strategy to achieve its climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the climate risks of increasing emissions, McDonald’s is exposing itself to reputational risk by failing to illustrate it is on track to meet its climate commitments. <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/greenwashing-rising-report-rep-risk-social-washing-sustainability/696289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental groups </a>have suggested companies, <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/mcdonalds-greenwashing-2655223811.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including McDonald’s</a>, may be misleading customers about the extent of their climate action, a phenomenon called “greenwashing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s has several initiatives to decrease the emissions from beef production. These plans aim to<a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce beef more sustainably</a> and<a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve soil’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide</a>. Still, the company <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/the-mcplant-is-out-but-the-mcrib-will-be-back-heres-when/476654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinued its only plant-based burger</a> in the United States, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its largest </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market</a> in terms of system-wide sales, signaling alternative proteins may not be a part of its approach to cutting climate emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“McDonald’s lacks alternative protein options that would help it reduce its beef-related emissions and demonstrate progress toward achieving its goals,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>hareholder </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>dvocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The happiest meal for investors is one that shows the company is reducing emissions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 </strong>– 5.1% of voting shares were cast on Wednesday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking Wendy’s for more details on how the company will achieve its sustainability goals. The fast food chain has pledged to reduce the climate impact of emissions drivers such as beef production across farms, franchises and other links in its supply chain.</p>



<p>“Investors want to know Wendy&#8217;s has a viable strategy to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Plans that directly address the highest-emitting parts of Wendy’s business are critical to making its climate roadmap a reality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef is a major climate emitter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all the goods Wendy’s purchases, beef is the main offender in increasing emissions. The United Nations reports that beef <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emits</a> more greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram than any other food. <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beef accounts for 58%</a> of the total emissions from the goods and services Wendy’s purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendys-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2023</a>, Wendy&#8217;s announced its first goals to reduce emissions from purchased goods and services and franchises by 2030. Reducing the climate footprint of its “fresh, never frozen” burgers is key to Wendy’s reaching its new, <a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> climate </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targets</a>, and the company identifies <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beef as one of four emissions </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot spots</a>.” Nevertheless, emissions from Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2024-05/Wendys-2023-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased goods and services have increased</a> since 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Wendy’s climate plans lack key details</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wendy’s sustainability report highlights steps to <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve its climate commitment— primarily through increasing innovation</a> rather than decreasing beef consumption. The company cites manure management and feed efficiency as key initiatives to cut emissions but lacks details about how specific projects, collaborations, or investments will make its emissions reduction plans a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Competitors including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have already taken steps that will reduce emissions from beef, such as introducing alternative proteins to their menus. Burger King’s Impossible<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Whopper <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/responsible-sourcing/beef-cow-methane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generates 89% fewer emissions</a> than a beef burger, helping the restaurant reach its own <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/planet/climate-action/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">climate commitment</a>. Although Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features “product mix”</a> as part of its roadmap to reduce emissions, it does not describe what this strategy entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wendy’s ambition to reduce its climate footprint will only benefit its business if it becomes reality,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Investors want to know more details on how the company plans to hit its climate goals.

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2023</strong> &#8211; Green Century° and the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, have filed a shareholder proposal with McDonald’s urging it to eliminate routine use of antibiotics that are important to protecting human health on the animals in its supply chains. The proposal goes to a vote on Thursday, May 25.</p>
<p>The Sisters had previously pressed McDonald’s to engage its pork and beef suppliers to phase out use of the types of antibiotics on their animals that people also use. In 2018, the Sisters filed a similar proposal and withdrew it in exchange for McDonald’s promise to announce reduction targets by 2020. McDonald’s failed to meet its promise.</p>
<p>Administering low doses of antibiotics in food and water can spur development of ‘superbugs’ in farm animals and create bacteria so resistant to treatment that even the most potent antibiotics can fail to stop the disease. There are a handful of transmission pathways for antibiotic-resistant bacteria that allow them to jump from farm animals to humans. Infection can happen through handling bacteria-laden meat from the supermarket, drinking water polluted by farm runoff, and direct contact with animals by farm workers and meat processors. In 2021, the United Nations announced that we may soon reach a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1106472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘tipping point’</a> when antimicrobial resistance becomes the leading cause of death – surpassing heart disease.</p>
<p>McDonald’s new <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsible use policy</a> encourages producers and veterinary professionals, among others, to “share responsibility for proactively developing and implementing effective best management strategies to reduce, and where possible eliminate, the need for [medically-important] antibiotic use.”</p>
<p>However, the policy falls short of the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment/">proposal’s request</a>. Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters had asked McDonald’s address use of antibiotics in its pork as well as beef supply chains. Further, the policy does not address the need for elimination targets, timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, or guidelines for enforcement when suppliers fail to meet McDonald’s guidelines.</p>
<p>“The upcoming vote is an opportunity for shareholders to assess the gap between what McDonald’s had stated it would do in the past to its new responsible use policy,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “In 2018, McDonald’s promised the nuns that it would announce targets by the end of 2020. It reneged and provided a responsible use policy that has no teeth. In my opinion, it appears to be more aspirational than actionable.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>
