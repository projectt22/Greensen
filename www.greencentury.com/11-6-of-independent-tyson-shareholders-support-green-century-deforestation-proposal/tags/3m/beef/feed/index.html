<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 10.5% of McDonald’s* shareholders cast their votes in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to assess whether its existing climate policies and plans are sufficient to achieve its emissions reduction targets. The resolution, which went to the ballot Tuesday, requests details on McDonald’s progress toward reaching its net-zero emissions by 2050 goal</p>



<p>“McDonald’s commitment to reducing carbon pollution shows that the company understands the risks that a warming planet poses to its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Now, McDonald’s must assure investors that it will live up to its commitments and take the necessary steps to meaningfully reduce climate-related risks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef has an outsized climate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/food-systems-responsible-for-one-third-of-human-caused-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our food system</a> accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and few meals we eat contribute to those emissions more than a burger. The life cycle of beef from farm to fork<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emits more greenhouse gas emissions</a> per kilogram than any other food, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular fast-food restaurants can play a key role in addressing climate change by buying and selling beef produced with processes that reduce emissions. Chains including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have added alternative-protein patties to their menus. Diversifying protein options to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption of beef is one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical method to cutting climate emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>McDonald’s </strong><strong>is slow </strong><strong>to show progress&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s set short- and long-term targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with what science says is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Because beef makes up about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/the-carbon-footprint-of-mcdonald-s-menu-very-big" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of the company&#8217;s total climate footprint</a>, reducing beef-related emissions is an impactful strategy to achieve its climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the climate risks of increasing emissions, McDonald’s is exposing itself to reputational risk by failing to illustrate it is on track to meet its climate commitments. <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/greenwashing-rising-report-rep-risk-social-washing-sustainability/696289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental groups </a>have suggested companies, <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/mcdonalds-greenwashing-2655223811.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including McDonald’s</a>, may be misleading customers about the extent of their climate action, a phenomenon called “greenwashing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s has several initiatives to decrease the emissions from beef production. These plans aim to<a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce beef more sustainably</a> and<a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve soil’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide</a>. Still, the company <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/the-mcplant-is-out-but-the-mcrib-will-be-back-heres-when/476654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinued its only plant-based burger</a> in the United States, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its largest </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market</a> in terms of system-wide sales, signaling alternative proteins may not be a part of its approach to cutting climate emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“McDonald’s lacks alternative protein options that would help it reduce its beef-related emissions and demonstrate progress toward achieving its goals,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>hareholder </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>dvocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The happiest meal for investors is one that shows the company is reducing emissions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 </strong>– 5.1% of voting shares were cast on Wednesday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking Wendy’s for more details on how the company will achieve its sustainability goals. The fast food chain has pledged to reduce the climate impact of emissions drivers such as beef production across farms, franchises and other links in its supply chain.</p>



<p>“Investors want to know Wendy&#8217;s has a viable strategy to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Plans that directly address the highest-emitting parts of Wendy’s business are critical to making its climate roadmap a reality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef is a major climate emitter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all the goods Wendy’s purchases, beef is the main offender in increasing emissions. The United Nations reports that beef <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emits</a> more greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram than any other food. <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beef accounts for 58%</a> of the total emissions from the goods and services Wendy’s purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendys-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2023</a>, Wendy&#8217;s announced its first goals to reduce emissions from purchased goods and services and franchises by 2030. Reducing the climate footprint of its “fresh, never frozen” burgers is key to Wendy’s reaching its new, <a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> climate </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targets</a>, and the company identifies <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beef as one of four emissions </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot spots</a>.” Nevertheless, emissions from Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2024-05/Wendys-2023-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased goods and services have increased</a> since 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Wendy’s climate plans lack key details</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wendy’s sustainability report highlights steps to <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve its climate commitment— primarily through increasing innovation</a> rather than decreasing beef consumption. The company cites manure management and feed efficiency as key initiatives to cut emissions but lacks details about how specific projects, collaborations, or investments will make its emissions reduction plans a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Competitors including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have already taken steps that will reduce emissions from beef, such as introducing alternative proteins to their menus. Burger King’s Impossible<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Whopper <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/responsible-sourcing/beef-cow-methane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generates 89% fewer emissions</a> than a beef burger, helping the restaurant reach its own <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/planet/climate-action/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">climate commitment</a>. Although Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features “product mix”</a> as part of its roadmap to reduce emissions, it does not describe what this strategy entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wendy’s ambition to reduce its climate footprint will only benefit its business if it becomes reality,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Investors want to know more details on how the company plans to hit its climate goals.

					<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Choice Hotels International*, one of the world&#8217;s leading lodging franchisors, has agreed to take the first step in addressing plastic pollution by conducting a program measure single-use plastic and develop strategies for single-use plastic reduction after engagement by Green Century°.</p>
<p>Choice Hotels, which has a diverse portfolio of 22 brands including Comfort Inn, Cambria Hotels, and Econo Lodge, will conduct a plastics reduction inventory program in 2024 and use it to set a new goal to reduce single-use plastic next year.</p>
<p>“As investors learn that plastic used for a minute can pollute our environment for hundreds of years, it has become a risk that companies need to manage,” said<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</a>. “We welcome Choice Hotel’s move to set a new plastic reduction goal.”</p>
<h4><strong>Choice Hotels, On of The Leading Lodging Franchisors, Agrees to Single-Use Plastic Study, Reduction</strong></h4>
<p>Choice Hotel’s commitment comes as consumers, investors, and regulators increasingly focus on the negative impacts of single-use plastic on the planet. According to a recent survey, 80% of U.S. respondents from across the political spectrum support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic.</p>
<p>“Delighting guests and reducing single-use plastics are clearly compatible,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</a>. “Customers want hospitality that doesn’t compromise the beauty of the places they might have traveled thousands of miles to visit.”</p>
<h4>It is estimated that two garbage trucks worth of plastic enter the ocean every minute.</h4>
<p>Recycling, long touted as the solution to the plastic waste crisis, has resulted in only 9% of plastic being recycled. Scientists and experts agree that the best way to reduce plastic pollution is to cut the amount of plastic companies are producing, and to replace non-essential single-use plastic with tested alternatives like reuseable containers.</p>
<p>“Choice is taking the first steps in addressing plastic pollution by better understanding how and how much plastic is used for its hotels,” added Guernsey. “The next step is to implement reductions, which will return long term value to consumers, the business, and investors.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, February 9, 2023 </strong>– Archer-Daniels-Midland Company* (ADM), one of the <a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/top-lists/top-10-companies-from-agriculture-industry-in-US-by-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest agricultural companies in the world</a>, has agreed to take important steps to help protect South American ecosystems critical to the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century Funds<em>°</em>, Robeco, and BNP Paribas Asset Management, ADM agreed to conduct a feasibility study in 2023 to determine when it can eliminate “native vegetation conversion” from its soy and corn supply chains in South America and issue a correlated commitment. In exchange, investors withdrew the proposal. Native vegetation conversion, or repurposing wild land for agriculture and other uses, <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/soy-made-the-cerrado-a-breadbasket-climate-change-may-end-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrades ecosystems such as the Cerrado</a> savanna in Brazil that are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.</p>
<p>“Places like the Cerrado may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they’re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, Green Century Funds’ president. “ADM’s commitment is an important step toward getting these critical biomes the safeguards they need.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Food &amp; agriculture contributes one-third of global climate emissions</strong></span></h3>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.adm.com/globalassets/sustainability/sustainability-reports/adm-h2-2021-soy-progress-report-compressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADM reported 97% deforestation- and conversion-free volumes for Brazilian soy</a> and announced at COP27 a commitment to <a href="https://www.tropicalforestalliance.org/assets/Agriculture-Sector-Roadmap-January-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct a global assessment in 2023</a> of the risk of native vegetation conversion to soy production. Green Century’s proposal asked ADM to expand its current plan to include an independently verified commitment to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its global supply chains by 2025.</p>
<p>“The global food and agriculture industry contributes about <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third</a> of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annie Sanders</a>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century Funds. “We look forward to working with ADM to eliminate native vegetation conversion in its supply chains as soon as possible in South America – and beyond.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Soy production is a leading cause of native vegetation conversion in South America</strong></span></h3>
<p>Soy production is a <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of native vegetation conversion</a> in South American biomes and part of a broader decline of South American wilderness. As the world’s most biodiverse savanna, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Cerrado houses 5% of the world’s animals and plants</a> including vulnerable species such as jaguars, maned wolves and giant anteaters. The <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/gran-chaco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Chaco</a> forest between the Cerrado and the Andes Mountains is the second-largest forest in South America, behind only the Amazon rainforest. Agriculture is projected to supplant millions of additional acres of native vegetation in the Gran Chaco by 2030.</p>
<p>“Forests are not the only landscapes that need protection. The Cerrado, for example, feeds 8 of 12 of Brazil’s major river basins and three aquifers. Native vegetation clearance has already been linked to decreased rainfall,” said Adam Kanzer, head of stewardship, Americas for BNP Paribas Asset Management. “Current policies could lead to very serious near-term consequences for Brazilian agriculture and human health. We commend ADM for agreeing to take a hard look at what it would take to adopt a more holistic approach to its most important South American supply chains.”</p>
<p>“By signing the COP26 Glasgow deforestation pledge, Robeco has committed to work towards eliminating agricultural-driven deforestation from our investment portfolios by 2025. For many years our engagement has focused on forest biomes such as the Amazon and boreal forests. However, with increasing corporate and legislative action on deforestation, pressures on non-forest biomes such as the Cerrado and Gran Chaco are growing.” says Peter van der Werf, Executive Director Active Ownership at Robeco. “By strengthening their approach to wider native vegetation conversion, ADM is protecting its license to operate and moving towards a future proof business model, safeguarding their key productive assets: the land and ecosystem services they depend on.”</p>
