<p><strong>Boston, June 26, 2025</strong> – Conagra Brands*, the parent company of Orville Redenbacher’s, Duncan Hines, Slim Jim and other well-known food brands will assess whether it should replicate the nature and biodiversity protections it employs in forests in non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco in Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.</p>



<p>“Food companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It’s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.”</p>



<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat</strong></p>



<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina. The Cerrado alone, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% of all species</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on Earth, has lost </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million acres of natural savanna</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in recent decades</a>. This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.</p>



<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection</strong></p>



<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company’s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;It’s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, June 20, 2025 – </strong><a href="https://www.conservationfund.org/our-impact/press-room/the-conservation-fund-halts-okefenokee-mining-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Conservation Fund</a> announced Friday that it had purchased land and mineral rights near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge from Twin Pines Minerals, LLC. The mining company had proposed a strip mine roughly three miles from the edge of the Okefenokee, the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/okefenokee/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest National Wildlife Refuge in the eastern</a> United States. </p>



<p>The proposed titanium mine could have contaminated Georgia’s most famous swamp,&nbsp;threatened the biodiversity-rich ecosystem, and <a href="https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Letter_RD%20to%20GA-EPD_TwinPines%20Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heightened the chances of wildfires.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For four years,<strong> </strong>Green Century° has pressed companies to avoid mining or selling products containing materials mined at the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Twin Pines’ move to sell this land only reinforces our position that mining at the Okefenokee quite simply isn’t worth the risks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a price tag of nearly $60 million, The Conservation Fund will acquire about 8,000 acres of land and the underlying mineral rights from Twin Pines Minerals, which had prior contractual relations with Chemours, located near the swamp that includes a section where the company had proposed a roughly 600-acre titanium mine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>The Okefenokee is a global biodiversity hotspot, freshwater wetland, and carbon sink</strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last fall, Green Century Capital Management and the Felician Sisters of North America Endowment Trust&nbsp;filed a shareholder resolution asking chemical company Chemours* to assess potentially irreversible biodiversity impacts before mining in ecologically sensitive areas, including at the Okefenokee. Most of Chemours&#8217; mining operations lie in a global biodiversity hotspot, where mining-related impacts such as water pollution and habitat degradation are particularly destructive. The proposal received sufficient investor support to refile in future years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As one of the largest freshwater <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wetlands</a> in the world, a massive carbon sink, and home to over 1,000 species of plants and animals, the Okefenokee is the last place we should be mining for anything,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century</strong>. “We applaud today’s news that this national treasure is one step closer to protection from harmful and unnecessary mining.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A shareholder proposal co-filed by Green Century Capital Management called on Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, to conduct a full assessment of its impact on nature and on the risks the company faces from the increasing instability of the natural environment. Company shareholders voted on the proposal at the company’s annual meeting Thursday. The proposal received 17% of votes cast, more than a similar proposal received at the company’s 2024 stockholder meeting.</p>



<p>“Home Depot sells lumber, paints, and herbicides, all of which adversely impact the environment, during either production or use,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company has a responsibility to shareholders and the planet to account for how its business affects nature.”</p>



<p><strong>Investors concerned about the health of the natural world</strong></p>



<p>Climate change, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are stressing the planet. In this context, investors have begun asking companies to fully disclose how their operations, sourcing and sales impact the environment. More than 350 companies have committed to providing a comprehensive accounting of these actions under the <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure</a>.  The proposal co-filed by Green Century asks Home Depot to provide a similar assessment. The initiative was led by Domini Impact Investments and was also supported by Proxy Impact on behalf of the Great Oaks Fund.</p>



<p>University of British Columbia Prof <a href="https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/suzanne-simard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanne Simard</a>, author of <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest</em>, presented the proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. In her remarks, Simard, a professor of forest ecology, described the important role of forests in mitigating climate change and how industrial logging degrades the health of forests. Home Depot sources approximately 17% of its lumber <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the pristine Canadian boreal</a> forests. Studies have documented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe long-term damage</a> from forestry practices in the boreal and how the increasing rate and severity of wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/12/climate/canada-wildfires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hampered the forest’s ability to recover and regrow</a>.</p>



<p>“Home Depot needs to do a better job of taking care of the home we all share: Earth,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“No one’s going to build a new deck when a wildfire’s burning in the back yard.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2025</strong> – J.M. Smucker*, parent company of Folgers, Café Bustelo and Dunkin’ at Home coffee products, has agreed to review its forest protection policies with an ambition of eventually sourcing all of its ingredients without any collateral deforestation. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century Capital Management.</p>



<p>“As investors, we encourage companies to reduce their material risks and improve their environmental impact,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Smuckers’ will follow up its research swiftly with a commitment to source coffee and other ingredients from verified deforestation-free sources.”</p>



<p>J.M. Smucker is the largest seller of at-home coffee in the <a href="https://www.jmsmucker.com/brands-you-love/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a>. It also produces its namesake jellies, Hostess Twinkies, Milk Bone dog biscuits, and a wide range of other popular <a href="https://www.jmsmucker.com/brands-you-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack and pet foods</a>. Coffee and other agricultural products are among the largest drivers of global <a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2022/06/deforestation-in-coffee-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Assessment followed by commitment</strong></p>



<p>As part of its agreement with Green Century, in 2025, J.M. Smucker will assess the steps necessary to ensure the company uses deforestation-free supplies of coffee, palm, soy and cocoa, as well as wood pulp used in packaging. The company plans to follow the assessment with a transition to deforestation-free supplies in 2026, as commercially feasible. Any policy adopted will include ongoing third-party assurance of forest protection practices as well as a grievance system for reporting violations.</p>



<p><strong>Forest protection is climate protection</strong></p>



<p>Deforestation and destruction of other natural habitats is responsible for <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Forests can also play an important role in removing carbon from the atmosphere, <a href="https://www.woodwellclimate.org/global-forest-carbon-storage-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but only if they are allowed to grow and thrive</a>. The <a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatest driver of deforestation globally is agriculture</a>, making it critical for food companies to commit to deforestation-free ingredients. </p>



<p>&#8220;J.M. Smucker has woken up and smelled the coffee,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;American consumers love their morning joe and they also want to protect the environment. These steps will help J.M. Smucker do both things, and provide sustainable coffee, snacks, and pet products.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 07, 2025</strong> – Shareholders sent a nature-positive message to PepsiCo* on Wednesday in response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century Capital Management. The proposal asked the company to assess its impact on nature and the systemic risks posed to the company by those impacts on the world around us.</p>



<p>“PepsiCo relies on nature for all the ingredients that go into its products, from corn and spices to fresh water,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company needs to do everything possible to ensure it’s not hurting healthy ecosystems. That will help reduce PepsiCo’s potential nature-related risks.”</p>



<p><strong>The natural world under pressure</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwcboosts-global-nature-and-biodiversity-capabilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half of global GDP </a>is dependent on natural inputs. Yet, the reliability of these inputs is increasingly uncertain. The United States incurred more than <a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-20-billion-question-hanging-over-americas-struggling-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 billion in crop losses last year because of extreme weather</a>. In addition, the global decline in pollinators has destabilized crop yields across two-thirds of the world. The <a href="https://octopart.com/pulse/p/extreme-weather-becomes-new-supply-chain-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disruption of nature </a>also impacts the <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transportation systems </a>that companies such as PepsiCo use to bring products to market. In 2024, wildfires, hurricanes and floods <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/weathers-wrath-supply-chains-reel-from-2024s-extreme-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down transport systems around the globe</a>, causing major disruptions in Canada, Mexico, China and Malaysia, among other places.</p>



<p><strong>Investors want transparency re: Pepsi’s impacts on nature</strong></p>



<p>This is the second year that Green Century has offered PepsiCo’s shareholders a proposal on biodiversity impacts. This year’s proposal was supported by 17.7% of PepsiCo shareholders. This vote will allow the resolution to be submitted again next year if the company does not take action. </p>



<p>“We hope that PepsiCo will hear the message of its shareholders: nature matters,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“Investors shouldn’t have to stay up at night wondering whether our company is putting critical ecosystems at risk to sell Doritos and Mountain Dew.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, April 24, 2025 – 6.4% of the Chemours Company’s* voting shareholders supported a resolution on Tuesday asking the company to adopt a policy to assess biodiversity impacts before mining [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p><strong>Boston, April 24, 2025 – </strong>6.4% of the Chemours Company’s* voting shareholders supported a resolution on Tuesday asking the company to adopt a policy to assess biodiversity impacts before mining in ecologically sensitive areas. Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, and the Felician Sisters of North America filed the proposal.</p>



<p>“Chemours should more thoroughly assess biodiversity risks before they can’t turn back the clock,” <strong>said Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>. “Since Chemours mines near ecological gems such as the Okefenokee Swamp, taking extra care to prevent irreversible damage to nature is a no-brainer.”</p>



<p>Chemours, which DuPont spun off in 2015, manufactures and sells “performance chemicals,” including titanium dioxide, a common whitener in products from toothpaste to sunscreen. Most of Chemours’ mining operations are in the North American Coastal Plain, a <a href="https://www.cepf.net/our-work/biodiversity-hotspots/north-american-coastal-plain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global biodiversity hotspot</a>, where mining-related impacts such as lowered groundwater levels, water pollution and habitat degradation would be particularly destructive.</p>



<p><strong>Mining in ecologically sensitive areas can drive biodiversity loss and climate change</strong></p>



<p>Overwhelming scientific consensus indicates that mining near the Okefenokee would significantly damage the swamp by drawing down its water level, tripling the frequency of drought and increasing the risk of <a href="https://www.fws.gov/story/2024-04/faq-okefenokee-nwr-and-twin-pines-mine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfires</a>. These repercussions would destroy swamp wildlife habitat, damage thousands of acres of adjacent private timberland and release millions of tons of climate-warming <a href="https://garivers.org/protectokefenokee-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions</a>.</p>



<p>“Habitat loss affects not only the land and its inhabitants but also the people who depend on the natural resources,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.felician.org/2020/10/28/sister-mary-jean-sliwinski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Sister Jean Sliwinski</strong></a><strong>, Province Sustainability Coordinator for the Felician Sisters of North America.</strong> “A broader, more long-term approach to assessing potential mining impacts is vital.”</p>



<p>Chemours doesn’t currently assess potentially irreversible biodiversity impacts from its mining operations, lagging a number of peers that do. The company also has a checkered environmental track record that has cost it nearly $1 billion since 2015 for various violations and <a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/?company_op=starts&amp;company=chemours&amp;offense_group=environment-related+offenses&amp;agency_code=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spills</a>. The recently voted-on proposal argued that an enhanced biodiversity assessment policy would reduce systemic, financial and competitive risks for the company.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone would say that slightly whiter toothpaste is worth irreversible biodiversity loss,” <strong>said Green Century Director of Shareholder Advocacy </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “We&#8217;ll keep pressing Chemours to ensure that it considers and protects biodiversity before mining starts. That’s what’s best for investors, customers, and the planet.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, February 20, 2025</strong> – Bloomin&#8217; Brands, parent company of several of the largest U.S. restaurant chains, has agreed to strengthen its commitment to protect forests when sourcing ingredients for its 1,480 restaurants around the world. The move came after Green Century Capital Management filed a shareholder proposal asking the company to assess its impact on biodiversity and nature loss.</p>



<p>“We congratulate Bloomin&#8217; Brands on strengthening its forest protection policies,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “When you go out for dinner, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry that people are cutting down forests in the Amazon so you can eat your meal.”</p>



<p>Bloomin&#8217; Brands owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and several other casual dining chains. Through direct ownership and franchises it is responsible for <a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/d653a2f0-ac33-4137-80f8-93636fba2f03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,150 restaurants in the United States</a> and smaller numbers in other countries.</p>



<p><strong>Beef and Palm Oil Drive Tropical Deforestation</strong></p>



<p>Beef and palm oil production are among the largest reasons for the loss of rainforests worldwide. In exchange for Green Century withdrawing its shareholder proposal, Bloomin&#8217; Brands agreed to strengthen its policies to protect forests when sourcing these ingredients. For the first time, the company will disclose the percentage of beef sourced from Brazil. In addition, Bloomin’ says it will ensure that 60% of that Brazilian beef will come from verified deforestation-free sources. The company says it aims to increase this commitment to 100% in the future.</p>



<p>Bloomin’ will also improve the traceability of its palm oil products and agreed to include biodiversity impacts in the double-materiality assessment it is undertaking in 2025.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bloomin&#8217; Brands has a significant presence in Brazil, raising the possibility that beef sold in the company’s restaurants contributes to forest loss in the Amazon,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;We appreciate the company&#8217;s willingness to begin tracking and disclosing its beef sourcing specific to Brazil. We hope this will pave the way for a commitment to 100% deforestation-free beef in the near future.&#8221; Green Century has been pressing Bloomin’ Brands to improve its forest protection policies for several years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/notable-43-of-bloomin-brands-shareholders-support-green-century-proposal-to-address-climate-change-and-deforestation/">43% of the company’s shareholders</a> voted in favor of a shareholder proposal by Green Century to address climate change and improve forest protection.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, December 17, 2024 – </strong>Procter &amp; Gamble, the international consumer goods company, has agreed to provide additional information regarding its practices related to sourcing wood pulp from the boreal forests of Canada. The updates will reiterate the company’s aim to eliminate sourcing from intact forest landscapes and to protect primary forests. Among the world’s largest and most important remaining forestlands, the boreal provides critical wildlife habitat and stores vast amounts of carbon. Procter &amp; Gamble uses some wood pulp from the boreal in the production of Charmin toilet paper, Bounty paper towels, and other consumer products.<br></p>



<p>The agreement came after discussions earlier this year with investment firms Green Century Capital Management, AXA Investment Managers, BNP Paribas Asset Management, and Robeco. In exchange, these investors agreed to withdraw a shareholder proposal asking the company to enhance its disclosures in relation to its existing efforts to mitigate risks to biodiversity and forest resilience.<br></p>



<p>“These disclosures will help investors better understand how P&amp;G is managing the risks associated with sourcing from such an ecologically important area,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “We’d prefer that the company eliminate its sourcing from the boreal. But if it is going to continue, it’s important that the company more clearly disclose its policies, practices and impact.”<br></p>



<p>This represents a significant milestone in the ongoing discussions between the investor group and the company, which aim to pursue their dialogue with P&amp;G and closely monitor the company’s efforts with regards to this important biome through enhanced disclosures.<br></p>



<p>In addition, P&amp;G will renew its investment in the development of alternative fibers. The company also agreed to increase disclosure of its advocacy and lobbying efforts related to robust forest management in Canadian forests.<br></p>



<p><strong>Multiple Pressures on the Boreal</strong><br>The boreal is under increasing ecological pressure from the combined effects of climate change and decades of logging. Recent years have seen a drop in caribou populations, considered an indicator of overall biodiversity decline. In 2023, wildfires consumed over 45 million acres of the boreal, roughly equal to the totals from the previous seven years combined.<br></p>



<p>“By relying on an increasingly fragile ecosystem, companies expose themselves to sourcing risks,” said Peter van der Werf, Head of Active Ownership at Robeco. “This is why we encouraged P&amp;G to explore how its vision for fiber resilience could be strengthened in the long run, a logical step for both its competitive standing and biodiversity<br></p>



<p>Adam Kanzer, Head of Stewardship, Americas at BNP Paribas Asset Management, added, “Degradation of the Canadian boreal is a key threat to diversified investors. We cannot afford to lose this critical carbon sink and cradle of biodiversity. These enhanced disclosures should provide investors with a clearer understanding of the role P&amp;G is playing. We hope that this will raise the bar for other companies as well.”</p>

<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, September 4, 2024 – Twenty investors representing over $695 billion in assets under management delivered a letter to Chemours* asking the chemical company to make permanent its near-term commitment [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p><strong>Boston, September 4, 2024 – </strong>Twenty investors representing over $695 billion in assets under management delivered a letter to Chemours* asking the chemical company to make permanent its near-term commitment to avoid mining at the Okefenokee swamp. The Okefenokee is one of the largest freshwater <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wetlands</a> in the world, a massive carbon sink, and home to over 1,000 species of plants and animals.</p>



<p>“Investors agree that the Okefenokee is the last place Chemours should set up shop,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. “Mining at this ecological gem would expose the company to a whole host of business risks that, quite simply, aren’t worth the reward.”</p>



<p>In the letter, investors articulated concerns that mining or purchasing materials mined at the Okefenokee could expose Chemours to undue financial risk including climate and biodiversity risk, regulatory and legal risk, and reputational risk. Numerous independent <a href="https://www.wabe.org/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists say</a> such mining poses an existential threat to the swamp, and according to a recent poll, nine out of ten Georgia voters are opposed to the mine. The Okefenokee was also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/okefenokee-wildlife-refuge-unesco-world-heritage-site-499cd975a576658966f7abef26dbba1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nominated</a> last year to the UNESCO World Heritage List to join such iconic sites as the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal.</p>



<p>“With growing risks and concerns around sustainable supply chains, we believe any Chemours involvement in mining such a sensitive area, one nominated for the UNESCO World Heritage List, would certainly present risks to the company, investors and this natural treasure,” said Ivan Frishberg, Chief Sustainability Officer for Amalgamated Bank.</p>



<p>Investors also raised concerns that Twin Pines Minerals (TPM), a mining company with a prior contractual relationship to Chemours and a <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/investigations/string-of-environmental-violations-raises-concerns-about-firm-linked-to-okefenokee-mine-project/HBPFQKRF2VEXDNNVFX57UHFVCQ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track record</a> of numerous environmental violations, was awarded draft mining permits at the Okefenokee earlier in 2024. The letter also highlighted that TPM’s northern neighbor, Toledo Manufacturing, has publicly called for mining on its land and TPM&#8217;s western neighbor, Rayonier Inc., has leased land to Chemours for titanium mining elsewhere in southeast Georgia.</p>



<p>“The Okefenokee is a precious resource worthy of protection over profit,” said Sister Jean Sliwinski, Provincial Sustainability Coordinator for the Felician Sisters of North America. “We are grateful for Chemours commitment and ask that they take the next step to prevent mining in this area.”</p>



<p>As a next step, investors hope to discuss strategies Chemours is undertaking to mitigate risk associated with titanium mining and purchasing titanium mined by others at the Okefenokee, especially in light of the aspiration articulated a recent Chemours Sustainability Report &#8220;to be the most sustainable TiO2 enterprise in the world.”</p>
