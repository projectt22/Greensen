<p><strong>Boston, February 20, 2025</strong> – Bloomin&#8217; Brands, parent company of several of the largest U.S. restaurant chains, has agreed to strengthen its commitment to protect forests when sourcing ingredients for its 1,480 restaurants around the world. The move came after Green Century Capital Management filed a shareholder proposal asking the company to assess its impact on biodiversity and nature loss.</p>



<p>“We congratulate Bloomin&#8217; Brands on strengthening its forest protection policies,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “When you go out for dinner, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry that people are cutting down forests in the Amazon so you can eat your meal.”</p>



<p>Bloomin&#8217; Brands owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and several other casual dining chains. Through direct ownership and franchises it is responsible for <a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/d653a2f0-ac33-4137-80f8-93636fba2f03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,150 restaurants in the United States</a> and smaller numbers in other countries.</p>



<p><strong>Beef and Palm Oil Drive Tropical Deforestation</strong></p>



<p>Beef and palm oil production are among the largest reasons for the loss of rainforests worldwide. In exchange for Green Century withdrawing its shareholder proposal, Bloomin&#8217; Brands agreed to strengthen its policies to protect forests when sourcing these ingredients. For the first time, the company will disclose the percentage of beef sourced from Brazil. In addition, Bloomin’ says it will ensure that 60% of that Brazilian beef will come from verified deforestation-free sources. The company says it aims to increase this commitment to 100% in the future.</p>



<p>Bloomin’ will also improve the traceability of its palm oil products and agreed to include biodiversity impacts in the double-materiality assessment it is undertaking in 2025.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bloomin&#8217; Brands has a significant presence in Brazil, raising the possibility that beef sold in the company’s restaurants contributes to forest loss in the Amazon,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;We appreciate the company&#8217;s willingness to begin tracking and disclosing its beef sourcing specific to Brazil. We hope this will pave the way for a commitment to 100% deforestation-free beef in the near future.&#8221; Green Century has been pressing Bloomin’ Brands to improve its forest protection policies for several years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/notable-43-of-bloomin-brands-shareholders-support-green-century-proposal-to-address-climate-change-and-deforestation/">43% of the company’s shareholders</a> voted in favor of a shareholder proposal by Green Century to address climate change and improve forest protection.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, April 25, 2023 –</strong> A notable 43% of restaurant company Bloomin’ Brands* shareholders voted in favor of Green Century Capital Management&#8217;s° shareholder proposal urging the company to set greenhouse gas reduction targets encompassing its supply chain emissions. Green Century had previously <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">secured a majority vote</a> on an emissions disclosure proposal at the restaurant parent company in 2021, but filed again due to what it viewed as insufficient progress.</p>
<p>“This is the third shareholder resolution we’ve filed with Bloomin’ Brands in four years,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/about-us/?gclid=CjwKCAjw0N6hBhAUEiwAXab-TWKBDG0nqSf-zKGCsqT7cpOnky5FLBfKRh7ozUex_S8YPL6cOCFX_BoCp8kQAvD_BwE">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Capital Management. “It is past time for the company to start taking investors’ climate concerns seriously. Climate change will affect every business, and this is especially true for food service companies like Bloomin’ that rely heavily on agricultural products.”</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008000;">Supply Chain Emissions a Concern</span></h2>
<p>Bloomin’ Brands is the parent company of Outback Steakhouse and Carrabba’s Italian Grill, among others, and operates more than <a href="https://www.bloominbrands.com/our-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,450 restaurants worldwide</a>. Bloomin’s supply chain emissions, like that of other restaurant chains, likely represent over 90% of its overall emissions. Beef, which accounts for the majority of <a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/082d94f0-181a-4fe6-8bc8-00a59e0fac2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomin’s purchased </a><a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/082d94f0-181a-4fe6-8bc8-00a59e0fac2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proteins</a>, is one of the most potent <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-is-eating-meat-bad-for-the-environment/a-63595148#:~:text=With%2099.48%20kilograms%20of%20carbon,mutton%20production%20(39.72%20kilograms)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributors</a> to climate change globally and is responsible for 41% of tropical <a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>
<p>“Shareholders sent a clear message in 2021 that Bloomin’ Brands must address supply chain emissions, but we’re still waiting,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management. “We look forward to seeing the company act on the strong shareholder support for this year’s proposal to set greenhouse gas reduction targets for its full supply chain.”</p>
<p>Climate change is directly driven by deforestation, which contributes nearly <a href="https://climatefundsupdate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CFF5-2019-ENG-DIGITAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12% of </a><a href="https://climatefundsupdate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CFF5-2019-ENG-DIGITAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human </a><a href="https://climatefundsupdate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CFF5-2019-ENG-DIGITAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Companies like Bloomin’ source beef, palm oil, soy and paper and pulp from locations with high risks of deforestation, like Brazil, where <a href="https://chainreactionresearch.com/report/cattle-driven-deforestation-a-major-risk-to-brazilian-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">land </a><a href="https://chainreactionresearch.com/report/cattle-driven-deforestation-a-major-risk-to-brazilian-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clearance </a><a href="https://chainreactionresearch.com/report/cattle-driven-deforestation-a-major-risk-to-brazilian-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for cattle</a> in particular is the primary driver of deforestation.</p>
<p>“Bloomin’ Brands can tackle two issues for the price of one by eliminating deforestation in its supply chain,” added <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/about-us/?gclid=CjwKCAjw0N6hBhAUEiwAXab-TWKBDG0nqSf-zKGCsqT7cpOnky5FLBfKRh7ozUex_S8YPL6cOCFX_BoCp8kQAvD_BwE">Guernsey</a>. “But the company must also set supply chain emissions reduction targets to start confronting these critical climate and deforestation risks.”</p>
