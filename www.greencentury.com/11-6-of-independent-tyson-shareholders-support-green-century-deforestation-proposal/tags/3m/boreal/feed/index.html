<p>A shareholder proposal co-filed by Green Century Capital Management called on Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, to conduct a full assessment of its impact on nature and on the risks the company faces from the increasing instability of the natural environment. Company shareholders voted on the proposal at the company’s annual meeting Thursday. The proposal received 17% of votes cast, more than a similar proposal received at the company’s 2024 stockholder meeting.</p>



<p>“Home Depot sells lumber, paints, and herbicides, all of which adversely impact the environment, during either production or use,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company has a responsibility to shareholders and the planet to account for how its business affects nature.”</p>



<p><strong>Investors concerned about the health of the natural world</strong></p>



<p>Climate change, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are stressing the planet. In this context, investors have begun asking companies to fully disclose how their operations, sourcing and sales impact the environment. More than 350 companies have committed to providing a comprehensive accounting of these actions under the <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure</a>.  The proposal co-filed by Green Century asks Home Depot to provide a similar assessment. The initiative was led by Domini Impact Investments and was also supported by Proxy Impact on behalf of the Great Oaks Fund.</p>



<p>University of British Columbia Prof <a href="https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/suzanne-simard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanne Simard</a>, author of <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest</em>, presented the proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. In her remarks, Simard, a professor of forest ecology, described the important role of forests in mitigating climate change and how industrial logging degrades the health of forests. Home Depot sources approximately 17% of its lumber <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the pristine Canadian boreal</a> forests. Studies have documented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe long-term damage</a> from forestry practices in the boreal and how the increasing rate and severity of wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/12/climate/canada-wildfires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hampered the forest’s ability to recover and regrow</a>.</p>



<p>“Home Depot needs to do a better job of taking care of the home we all share: Earth,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“No one’s going to build a new deck when a wildfire’s burning in the back yard.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, December 17, 2024 – Procter &#38; Gamble, the international consumer goods company, has agreed to provide additional information regarding its practices related to sourcing wood pulp from the boreal [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					
<p><strong>Boston, December 17, 2024 – </strong>Procter &amp; Gamble, the international consumer goods company, has agreed to provide additional information regarding its practices related to sourcing wood pulp from the boreal forests of Canada. The updates will reiterate the company’s aim to eliminate sourcing from intact forest landscapes and to protect primary forests. Among the world’s largest and most important remaining forestlands, the boreal provides critical wildlife habitat and stores vast amounts of carbon. Procter &amp; Gamble uses some wood pulp from the boreal in the production of Charmin toilet paper, Bounty paper towels, and other consumer products.<br></p>



<p>The agreement came after discussions earlier this year with investment firms Green Century Capital Management, AXA Investment Managers, BNP Paribas Asset Management, and Robeco. In exchange, these investors agreed to withdraw a shareholder proposal asking the company to enhance its disclosures in relation to its existing efforts to mitigate risks to biodiversity and forest resilience.<br></p>



<p>“These disclosures will help investors better understand how P&amp;G is managing the risks associated with sourcing from such an ecologically important area,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “We’d prefer that the company eliminate its sourcing from the boreal. But if it is going to continue, it’s important that the company more clearly disclose its policies, practices and impact.”<br></p>



<p>This represents a significant milestone in the ongoing discussions between the investor group and the company, which aim to pursue their dialogue with P&amp;G and closely monitor the company’s efforts with regards to this important biome through enhanced disclosures.<br></p>



<p>In addition, P&amp;G will renew its investment in the development of alternative fibers. The company also agreed to increase disclosure of its advocacy and lobbying efforts related to robust forest management in Canadian forests.<br></p>



<p><strong>Multiple Pressures on the Boreal</strong><br>The boreal is under increasing ecological pressure from the combined effects of climate change and decades of logging. Recent years have seen a drop in caribou populations, considered an indicator of overall biodiversity decline. In 2023, wildfires consumed over 45 million acres of the boreal, roughly equal to the totals from the previous seven years combined.<br></p>



<p>“By relying on an increasingly fragile ecosystem, companies expose themselves to sourcing risks,” said Peter van der Werf, Head of Active Ownership at Robeco. “This is why we encouraged P&amp;G to explore how its vision for fiber resilience could be strengthened in the long run, a logical step for both its competitive standing and biodiversity<br></p>



<p>Adam Kanzer, Head of Stewardship, Americas at BNP Paribas Asset Management, added, “Degradation of the Canadian boreal is a key threat to diversified investors. We cannot afford to lose this critical carbon sink and cradle of biodiversity. These enhanced disclosures should provide investors with a clearer understanding of the role P&amp;G is playing. We hope that this will raise the bar for other companies as well.”</p>
