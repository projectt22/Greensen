<p><strong>Boston, February 20, 2025</strong> – Bloomin&#8217; Brands, parent company of several of the largest U.S. restaurant chains, has agreed to strengthen its commitment to protect forests when sourcing ingredients for its 1,480 restaurants around the world. The move came after Green Century Capital Management filed a shareholder proposal asking the company to assess its impact on biodiversity and nature loss.</p>



<p>“We congratulate Bloomin&#8217; Brands on strengthening its forest protection policies,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “When you go out for dinner, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry that people are cutting down forests in the Amazon so you can eat your meal.”</p>



<p>Bloomin&#8217; Brands owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and several other casual dining chains. Through direct ownership and franchises it is responsible for <a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/d653a2f0-ac33-4137-80f8-93636fba2f03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,150 restaurants in the United States</a> and smaller numbers in other countries.</p>



<p><strong>Beef and Palm Oil Drive Tropical Deforestation</strong></p>



<p>Beef and palm oil production are among the largest reasons for the loss of rainforests worldwide. In exchange for Green Century withdrawing its shareholder proposal, Bloomin&#8217; Brands agreed to strengthen its policies to protect forests when sourcing these ingredients. For the first time, the company will disclose the percentage of beef sourced from Brazil. In addition, Bloomin’ says it will ensure that 60% of that Brazilian beef will come from verified deforestation-free sources. The company says it aims to increase this commitment to 100% in the future.</p>



<p>Bloomin’ will also improve the traceability of its palm oil products and agreed to include biodiversity impacts in the double-materiality assessment it is undertaking in 2025.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bloomin&#8217; Brands has a significant presence in Brazil, raising the possibility that beef sold in the company’s restaurants contributes to forest loss in the Amazon,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;We appreciate the company&#8217;s willingness to begin tracking and disclosing its beef sourcing specific to Brazil. We hope this will pave the way for a commitment to 100% deforestation-free beef in the near future.&#8221; Green Century has been pressing Bloomin’ Brands to improve its forest protection policies for several years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/notable-43-of-bloomin-brands-shareholders-support-green-century-proposal-to-address-climate-change-and-deforestation/">43% of the company’s shareholders</a> voted in favor of a shareholder proposal by Green Century to address climate change and improve forest protection.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 7, 2024</strong> – Shareholders prepare to vote on a Green Century <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465924040871/tm2318496-d4_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a> at Ford’s May 9 annual general meeting. The proposal asks Ford to disclose deforestation risk associated with the leather, rubber, and minerals it buys, and encourages the company to support efforts to expand supplies of green steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for  car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raising cattle</a>, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting rubber</a>, and <a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/1827220/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining minerals</a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage. However, the company is silent on how these materials could lead to long-term environmental damage, especially in vulnerable areas like Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Ford has committed to buying <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/11/09/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green primary steel and aluminum for 10%</a> of its total purchase by 2030. Yet not one ton of green steel or aluminum is manufactured currently in the United States. The proposal asks Ford how it will attain its 2030 goal and to join NGO-led organizations like ResponsibleSteel and the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative (ASI), which support sustainable production of these metals.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled that Ford is advancing quickly to manufacture climate friendly vehicles – like EVs,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “But the company faces material risk in its supply chain from the products it uses. Companies have to be relentless in investigating and changing their total impact on the environment.”</p>
<p><strong>Competitors Exceed Ford On Green Steel and Aluminum </strong></p>
<p>Volvo and Mercedes-Benz participate in the steel plant sustainability standard, <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a>, and Volvo has joined <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/about-steelzero-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelZero</a>, where members commit purchasing 100% green steel by 2050. Ford would be the first North American auto manufacturer to participate in these initiatives and could accelerate the wider availability of green metals.</p>
<p>“Ford’s Road to Better slogan describes its commitment to building a more sustainable  transportation future,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Instead of  fighting our proposal at the ballot box, we want Ford to remain on the Road to Better. We believe Ford should implement our proposal to protect nature and biodiversity and ensure it supports  development of steel and aluminum manufacturing that is powered by renewable energy.”</p>

<p>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495; Annie Sanders, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 14, 2024</strong> – A noteworthy 11.6% of independent Tyson Foods* shareholders voted in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal urging the company to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains by 2025. Independent shareholders include all shares that are not held by Tyson Limited Partnership or Tyson’s directors or executive officers.</p>
<p>“Independent shareholders have sent a strong message that Tyson can’t put deforestation on the back burner,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. “Tyson should step up to the plate and make sure its meat doesn’t come with a side of forest destruction.”</p>
<p>The pace of deforestation broke records in 2023 in the Brazilian Cerrado, the world&#8217;s most biologically rich savanna, surging by nearly 45% since 2022. To produce its extensive line of meat products, Tyson Foods buys ingredients from countries around the world, including from high-risk regions such as Brazil where cattle ranching is the largest driver of <a href="https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/brasil/tnc-execs-environmentalframeworkcattle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Tyson’s Deforestation Goals Fall Short</strong></span></p>
<p>Tyson aims to achieve a deforestation-free beef supply chain by the end of 2028 and to eliminate deforestation in its soy and palm oil supply chains by 2030. These goals fall 3-5 years short of recommendations from standard-setting bodies that have concluded that companies can’t hit their climate targets without eliminating deforestation by <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors/forest-land-and-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025</a>.</p>
<p>Tyson also lags peers including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-hormel-foods-commits-to-no-deforestation-by-2025/">Hormel Foods</a>* and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/processed-food-giant-conagra-to-eliminate-deforestation-from-its-supply-chains/">Conagra</a>*, both of which recently pledged to be deforestation-free by 2025.</p>
<p>“This vote demonstrates a growing understanding among investors that deforestation in Tyson’s supply chain exposes the company to material risks,” said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “We urge the company to take investor concern seriously and accelerate progress toward zero-deforestation.”</p>
<p>The Tyson family’s control of Class B shares means it holds up to 70% of the voting rights at the <a href="https://www.pionline.com/governance/new-york-state-common-challenges-tysons-dual-share-stock-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company</a>. The support from independent shareholders is approximate and was calculated under the assumption that Tyson insiders, Tyson Limited Partnership, Tyson’s directors, and executive officers voted against the proposal.</p>
