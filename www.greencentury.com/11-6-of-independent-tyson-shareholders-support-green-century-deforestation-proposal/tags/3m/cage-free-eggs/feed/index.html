					<h2>Classic Hostess brands agree to use cage-free eggs after Green Century engagement.</h2>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(BOSTON)</strong> J. M. Smucker Co* announced that its Hostess brand, which includes iconic snack products like Twinkies, Snowballs and CupCakes, will be switching completely to direct purchases of cage-free eggs by 2028. J. M. Smucker achieved a 100% cage-free egg supply before acquiring the Hostess brand in 2023. Hostess previously did not use cage-free eggs.</p>
<p>J. M. Smucker Co made the commitment after signing an agreement with Green Century.</p>
<p>“Bringing cage-free eggs to an iconic American brand like Hostess means happier hens and healthier snacks,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We admire Smucker’s commitment, proving that big brands play a key role in building a more ethical food industry.”</p>
<p>Smucker’s provided a glidepath towards reaching its cage-free egg goal and will transparently report on its progress annually in its sustainability report.</p>
<h3>Green Century’s advocacy promotes animal welfare</h3>
<p>Green Century has taken a leading role in promoting animal welfare at major brands advocating for healthy and humane conditions for animals. Carl Icahn nominated Samuelrich in 2022 for the board of McDonald’s after the company backed away from its gestation crate-free pork pledge. Green Century also recently filed a shareholder resolution at Darden, parent company of Olive Garden, asking the company to commit to removing gestation crates from its supply chain.</p>
<p>“Growing visibility into supply chains means that animal welfare can no longer be ‘out of sight, out of mind’,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate</strong>. “Consumers will continue to learn about &#8211; and demand &#8211; better treatment for animals in agriculture.”</p>
<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</strong></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 19, 2023</strong> – – Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc., a food company known for its popular snack brands, such as Chips Ahoy!, Cadbury, Ritz, and Oreo, were reluctant to support a Green Century° <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000130817923000589/lmdlz2023_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a>, as evidenced by the vote tally released on Friday. The proposal, which asks Mondelēz to disclose interim targets for achieving its goal to source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025, captured <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000110398223000025/mdlz-20230517.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.8% of the total vote</a>.</p>
<p>Demand for cage-free eggs, and the supply to match it, has grown dramatically in the U.S. and European Union in recent years –driven by consumer awareness of and desire for humanely-raised animal proteins as well as government pressure on manufacturers to switch to producing cage-free eggs. The term “cage-free” was coined in response to farmers’ use of “battery cages,” where hens are housed in spaces that are smaller than the size of a piece of printer paper.</p>
<p>Mondelēz first announced in 2016 that it would source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025. However, recent company disclosures of current sourcing volumes indicate that it is unlikely to meet its goal, which prompted the Green Century proposal. In recent years, excluding its Russian and Ukrainian egg markets, Mondelēz sourced cage-free eggs at a rate of 27% in 2020, 39% in 2021, and 43% in 2022. Extrapolating from its current progress, Mondelēz would achieve a sourcing rate of only 59% by the end of 2025, far short of its original ambition.</p>
<p>However, Mondelēz peers, General Mills and Conagra, disclose their planned progressions toward their global cage-free egg targets and are further along in achieving their goals than Mondelēz. Further, Target and a wide range of quick service food retailers including Jack in the Box, Denny’s, Bloomin’ Brands (the parent of Olive Garden) have also disclosed similar cage-free egg glide paths to their shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> responded to the vote result by saying: </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>“While we had hoped for greater support for our proposal, this is the first year we’ve brought this issue of cage-free egg goals to Mondelēz shareholders for a vote. Without publishing a clear path for achieving its 2050 cage-free egg sourcing goal, Mondelēz may be inviting unnecessary risk by being seen as not living up to its obligations. This is especially true because we’re talking about a sensitive animal welfare issue that has quite a bit of public support.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Disclosure is central to investor decision making, but Mondelēz has told us that disclosing interim targets for its 100% cage-free egg by 2050 goal would be “burdensome, unnecessary…. and could generate confusion among our stakeholders.” Given that it’s now 2023 and Mondelēz committed to reach its goal in 2025, one has to ask, does it really have a plan? If so, why wouldn’t it share it with investors?  For the sake of its investors, customers, and the health of the animals in its supply chain, I hope it does and it will.”</p>
