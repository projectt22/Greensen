					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813<br />
Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, July 10, 2023</strong> &#8212; <a href="http://carmax.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CarMax, Inc.</a>, the largest used vehicle retailer in the U.S., has committed to strengthening its carbon offsets disclosure so that shareholders can assess whether the company is on track to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. In response, Green Century<em>°</em>, with lead-filer As You Sow, withdrew a shareholder proposal for CarMax’s 2023 annual meeting.</p>
<p>In exchange for the withdrawal, CarMax agreed to several steps. It will publicly disclose any carbon offsets and renewable energy purchased to meet its <a href="https://media.carmax.com/press-releases/news-release/2022/CarMax-Releases-2022-Responsibility-Report/default.aspx#:~:text=Achieving%20net%2Dzero%20carbon%20emissions,accordance%20with%20the%20Paris%20Agreement." target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal</a> of a 50% reduction by 2025 in emissions generated by its operations.  It will also share its criteria for procuring high-quality carbon offsets. Further, CarMax will disclose details of any projects involving purchases of carbon offsets and renewable energy, including the project names, locations, and third-party verification of the projects’ authenticity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds, stated, &#8220;We applaud CarMax&#8217;s commitment to disclosing its carbon offsets and renewable energy purchases and see it as an important step toward greater transparency. Investors need this clarity to understand companies’ climate risk and how they plan to address it. We have little time to waste in order to prevent predicted catastrophic impacts from climate change and to transition to a clean energy economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-launches-world-first-net-zero-corporate-standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)</a> has said that on average companies should reduce 90% of their emissions by 2050. Some shareholders believe that companies are relying on carbon offsets to meet their near-term and medium-term greenhouse gas reduction targets. Green Century’s engagement will help clarify the reasons why CarMax is purchasing carbon offsets and whether the company is on track to make SBTi’s recommended 90% emissions cuts by 2050.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century, said, &#8220;It is critical that companies making net-zero or greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets have a viable pathway for achieving those goals. We believe that carbon offsets should only be used to address hard-to-eliminate emissions and that companies should primarily focus on cutting emissions to achieve their emissions reduction goals.&#8221;</p>

					<p><b>Media Contacts: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, June 26, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Green Century° withdrew a shareholder proposal with tech giant Alphabet after the company agreed to provide greater visibility into its use of carbon offsets.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://abc.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alphabet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relies on carbon offsets, also known as carbon credits, to neutralize the emissions it’s not able to eliminate through other methods, such as through energy efficiency or renewable energy. Following the Green Century engagement, the company has now agreed to annually disclose its criteria, approach, and portfolio, including details on project purchases and any relevant certifications related to its purchases of carbon offsets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite earlier commitments and a </span><a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//green/pdfs/google-carbon-offsets.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing its strategy for buying “high-quality carbon offsets,” which are known for longevity and verifiability, Alphabet’s full disclosure in 2022 fell short. In a single sentence in its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual environmental report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company vaguely stated “[We] plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on carbon offsets to neutralize emissions is currently an area of intense debate. Some academics and NGOs are urging potential buyers to be cautious as research about how different projects absorb carbon, methodology for measuring offsets, and ability to verify the durability of the offsets evolve.  At minimum, more robust disclosure may be advised, and the agreement secured by Green Century should help investors better assess  Alphabet’s carbon offset purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m pleased that Alphabet sees the value in revisiting its carbon offsets disclosure policy,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Green Century, and I expect many, many investors, value insight into how Alphabet is managing its climate risk.  I believe embracing transparency will only help it select offsets wisely and avoid the greenwashing label.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has weighed in on the issue. In its proposed climate rule, the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SEC expresses an interest in learning how companies use carbon offsets to reach their climate-related goals, and the regulator may require companies to disclose their carbon reductions represented by these offsets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alphabet is a leader in many respects &#8211; the amount of renewable energy it procures, the energy efficiency it incorporates, and its ability to maintain carbon neutrality. Becoming a leader in carbon offsets seems like a natural step forward,” added Shareholder Advocate </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I think our proposal was a wake up call for Alphabet. Investors like us are analyzing corporate climate commitments very closely, and we want to see that claims of emissions reductions using offsets are actually true.”</span></p>
