<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813<br />
Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, July 10, 2023</strong> &#8212; <a href="http://carmax.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CarMax, Inc.</a>, the largest used vehicle retailer in the U.S., has committed to strengthening its carbon offsets disclosure so that shareholders can assess whether the company is on track to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. In response, Green Century<em>°</em>, with lead-filer As You Sow, withdrew a shareholder proposal for CarMax’s 2023 annual meeting.</p>
<p>In exchange for the withdrawal, CarMax agreed to several steps. It will publicly disclose any carbon offsets and renewable energy purchased to meet its <a href="https://media.carmax.com/press-releases/news-release/2022/CarMax-Releases-2022-Responsibility-Report/default.aspx#:~:text=Achieving%20net%2Dzero%20carbon%20emissions,accordance%20with%20the%20Paris%20Agreement." target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal</a> of a 50% reduction by 2025 in emissions generated by its operations.  It will also share its criteria for procuring high-quality carbon offsets. Further, CarMax will disclose details of any projects involving purchases of carbon offsets and renewable energy, including the project names, locations, and third-party verification of the projects’ authenticity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds, stated, &#8220;We applaud CarMax&#8217;s commitment to disclosing its carbon offsets and renewable energy purchases and see it as an important step toward greater transparency. Investors need this clarity to understand companies’ climate risk and how they plan to address it. We have little time to waste in order to prevent predicted catastrophic impacts from climate change and to transition to a clean energy economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/news/sbti-launches-world-first-net-zero-corporate-standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)</a> has said that on average companies should reduce 90% of their emissions by 2050. Some shareholders believe that companies are relying on carbon offsets to meet their near-term and medium-term greenhouse gas reduction targets. Green Century’s engagement will help clarify the reasons why CarMax is purchasing carbon offsets and whether the company is on track to make SBTi’s recommended 90% emissions cuts by 2050.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century, said, &#8220;It is critical that companies making net-zero or greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets have a viable pathway for achieving those goals. We believe that carbon offsets should only be used to address hard-to-eliminate emissions and that companies should primarily focus on cutting emissions to achieve their emissions reduction goals.&#8221;</p>
