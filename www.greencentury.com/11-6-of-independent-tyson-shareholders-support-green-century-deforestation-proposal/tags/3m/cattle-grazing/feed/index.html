					<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Choice Hotels International*, one of the world&#8217;s leading lodging franchisors, has agreed to take the first step in addressing plastic pollution by conducting a program measure single-use plastic and develop strategies for single-use plastic reduction after engagement by Green Century°.</p>
<p>Choice Hotels, which has a diverse portfolio of 22 brands including Comfort Inn, Cambria Hotels, and Econo Lodge, will conduct a plastics reduction inventory program in 2024 and use it to set a new goal to reduce single-use plastic next year.</p>
<p>“As investors learn that plastic used for a minute can pollute our environment for hundreds of years, it has become a risk that companies need to manage,” said<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</a>. “We welcome Choice Hotel’s move to set a new plastic reduction goal.”</p>
<h4><strong>Choice Hotels, On of The Leading Lodging Franchisors, Agrees to Single-Use Plastic Study, Reduction</strong></h4>
<p>Choice Hotel’s commitment comes as consumers, investors, and regulators increasingly focus on the negative impacts of single-use plastic on the planet. According to a recent survey, 80% of U.S. respondents from across the political spectrum support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic.</p>
<p>“Delighting guests and reducing single-use plastics are clearly compatible,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</a>. “Customers want hospitality that doesn’t compromise the beauty of the places they might have traveled thousands of miles to visit.”</p>
<h4>It is estimated that two garbage trucks worth of plastic enter the ocean every minute.</h4>
<p>Recycling, long touted as the solution to the plastic waste crisis, has resulted in only 9% of plastic being recycled. Scientists and experts agree that the best way to reduce plastic pollution is to cut the amount of plastic companies are producing, and to replace non-essential single-use plastic with tested alternatives like reuseable containers.</p>
<p>“Choice is taking the first steps in addressing plastic pollution by better understanding how and how much plastic is used for its hotels,” added Guernsey. “The next step is to implement reductions, which will return long term value to consumers, the business, and investors.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, February 9, 2023 </strong>– Archer-Daniels-Midland Company* (ADM), one of the <a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/top-lists/top-10-companies-from-agriculture-industry-in-US-by-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest agricultural companies in the world</a>, has agreed to take important steps to help protect South American ecosystems critical to the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century Funds<em>°</em>, Robeco, and BNP Paribas Asset Management, ADM agreed to conduct a feasibility study in 2023 to determine when it can eliminate “native vegetation conversion” from its soy and corn supply chains in South America and issue a correlated commitment. In exchange, investors withdrew the proposal. Native vegetation conversion, or repurposing wild land for agriculture and other uses, <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/soy-made-the-cerrado-a-breadbasket-climate-change-may-end-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrades ecosystems such as the Cerrado</a> savanna in Brazil that are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.</p>
<p>“Places like the Cerrado may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they’re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, Green Century Funds’ president. “ADM’s commitment is an important step toward getting these critical biomes the safeguards they need.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Food &amp; agriculture contributes one-third of global climate emissions</strong></span></h3>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.adm.com/globalassets/sustainability/sustainability-reports/adm-h2-2021-soy-progress-report-compressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADM reported 97% deforestation- and conversion-free volumes for Brazilian soy</a> and announced at COP27 a commitment to <a href="https://www.tropicalforestalliance.org/assets/Agriculture-Sector-Roadmap-January-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct a global assessment in 2023</a> of the risk of native vegetation conversion to soy production. Green Century’s proposal asked ADM to expand its current plan to include an independently verified commitment to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its global supply chains by 2025.</p>
<p>“The global food and agriculture industry contributes about <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third</a> of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annie Sanders</a>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century Funds. “We look forward to working with ADM to eliminate native vegetation conversion in its supply chains as soon as possible in South America – and beyond.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Soy production is a leading cause of native vegetation conversion in South America</strong></span></h3>
<p>Soy production is a <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of native vegetation conversion</a> in South American biomes and part of a broader decline of South American wilderness. As the world’s most biodiverse savanna, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Cerrado houses 5% of the world’s animals and plants</a> including vulnerable species such as jaguars, maned wolves and giant anteaters. The <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/gran-chaco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Chaco</a> forest between the Cerrado and the Andes Mountains is the second-largest forest in South America, behind only the Amazon rainforest. Agriculture is projected to supplant millions of additional acres of native vegetation in the Gran Chaco by 2030.</p>
<p>“Forests are not the only landscapes that need protection. The Cerrado, for example, feeds 8 of 12 of Brazil’s major river basins and three aquifers. Native vegetation clearance has already been linked to decreased rainfall,” said Adam Kanzer, head of stewardship, Americas for BNP Paribas Asset Management. “Current policies could lead to very serious near-term consequences for Brazilian agriculture and human health. We commend ADM for agreeing to take a hard look at what it would take to adopt a more holistic approach to its most important South American supply chains.”</p>
<p>“By signing the COP26 Glasgow deforestation pledge, Robeco has committed to work towards eliminating agricultural-driven deforestation from our investment portfolios by 2025. For many years our engagement has focused on forest biomes such as the Amazon and boreal forests. However, with increasing corporate and legislative action on deforestation, pressures on non-forest biomes such as the Cerrado and Gran Chaco are growing.” says Peter van der Werf, Executive Director Active Ownership at Robeco. “By strengthening their approach to wider native vegetation conversion, ADM is protecting its license to operate and moving towards a future proof business model, safeguarding their key productive assets: the land and ecosystem services they depend on.”</p>
