										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">

					<p><strong>Boston, April 29, 2024</strong> – Bunge Global SA*, a leading global agribusiness company, has agreed to report on deforestation and conversion risks in its supply chain and take immediate corrective action to protect tropical ecosystems. The commitment came in response to a shareholder proposal from six investors – Green Century°, AXA Investment Managers, Nordea Asset Management, Schroders, Storebrand Asset Management and UBS Asset Management – asking the company to address deforestation risks driven by its current policies.</p>
<p>In exchange for withdrawal of the proposal, Bunge also committed to 100% geospatial monitoring for soy and enhanced disclosure of traceability for indirect suppliers (where soy is mixed from multiple farms). The report will cover both legal and illegal deforestation, as well as native vegetation conversion, or the repurposing of wild land for agriculture.</p>
<p>“Biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon and Cerrado, home to animals from jaguars to giant otters, are the last places we should be clearing forests for food,” said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “We congratulate Bunge on taking steps to more fully protect the rich biodiversity of these special places.”</p>
<h3><strong>Investors Concerned About a “Race to Deforest”</strong></h3>
<p>In 2021, Green Century and Storebrand filed a shareholder resolution asking Bunge to accelerate efforts to eliminate conversion from its supply chain, which received a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">98% majority vote</a> with support from the board. Although the company had already committed to eliminate deforestation by 2025, investors remained concerned that its 2025 “<a href="https://www.feedandgrain.com/sustainability/news/15541156/report-links-bunge-to-soyrelated-deforestation#:~:text=Bunge%20confirmed%20to%20Mighty%20Earth%20that%20it%20does%20not%20have,its%20supply%20chain%20until%202025." target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut-off date</a>,” which allows the company to buy crops from land deforested through the end of 2025, effectively incentivizes a race to deforest until that date.</p>
<p>”Bunge’s 2025 target is great, but without a cut-off date in the past, there is a risk that farmers will rush to clear forests for new fields before the deforestation ban kicks in,” said Vemund Olsen, senior sustainability analyst at Storebrand Asset Management. “We’re glad to see that Bunge has committed to report on the risk of inadvertently incentivizing deforestation and we hope the company will take appropriate corrective action.”</p>
<p>Deforestation and native vegetation conversion <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrade ecosystems such as the Cerrado</a> savanna in Brazil that are critical to preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Soy production is a <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of native vegetation conversion</a> in South American habitats and contributes to a broader decline of South American wilderness.</p>
<p>“The global agribusiness industry as a whole should do more to protect complex and valuable ecosystems,” said Michaela Zhirova, engagement specialist at Nordea Asset Management. “We hope any progress Bunge makes would help to lift the baseline for the entire sector.”</p>
<h3><strong>Pressure Mounts to Halt Deforestation</strong></h3>
<p>The urgency of the twin climate and biodiversity crises coupled with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/policies-tackling-deforestation-pose-investor-risk-report-says-2024-03-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 new policies last year</a> to halt deforestation and nature loss highlight the imperative for companies to eliminate deforestation by 2025. The highly concentrated agribusiness sector is under particular pressure to reduce its environmental and biodiversity footprint, as reputational risk and the risk of market access disruption due to emerging regulation could prove a persistent threat to business models.</p>
<p>“Deforestation risk in this region is directly linked to managing investment risk on behalf of our clients,” said Sarah Woodfield, biodiversity engagement lead at Schroders. “The current economic factors driving demand for soy have prompted us to ask companies like Bunge to more fully address related risks.”</p>
<p>The agreement marks a new phase in the multi-year deforestation engagement with Bunge. The investor group plans to continue its dialogue with the company on these and connected issues, and on the fulfillment of Bunge’s most recent commitments.</p>
<p>“Companies and their investors have a key role to play in driving meaningful change in value chains, particularly in critical biomes,” said Sanders. “We’re hopeful that Bunge will achieve deforestation and conversion-free supply chains as soon as possible.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, April 22, 2024</strong> – Archer-Daniels-Midland Company* (ADM), one of the largest agricultural companies in the world, has released a <a href="https://www.adm.com/en-us/sustainability/no-conversion-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> that informed a <a href="https://www.adm.com/globalassets/sustainability/goals--programs/protect-biodiversity-forests-communities/11-2023-protect-biodiversity-forests-communities-enlgish.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new policy</a> to enhance protections for South American ecosystems key to global biodiversity and the fight against climate change. ADM’s new policy will eliminate primary native vegetation conversion, or the repurposing of wild land for crops such as soy and corn, from its global supply chains by 2025 for direct suppliers and by 2027 for indirect suppliers.</p>
<p>“Critical ecosystems like the Cerrado, Gran Chaco and Pantanal may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they’re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds°. “We congratulate ADM on enhancing protections for these special places.”</p>
<p><strong>Shareholder Proposal Prompted Study, Protections </strong></p>
<p>In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Robeco and BNP Paribas Asset Management, ADM had agreed in spring 2023 to conduct a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/adm-moves-to-strengthen-no-deforestation-policy/">feasibility study</a> to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its South American soy and corn supply chains and issue a correlated commitment. The feasibility study completed in November 2023 and published in April 2024 informed ADM’s new “no-conversion” commitment, which covers supply chains in the Brazilian Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, as well as the Paraguayan and Argentinian Chaco.</p>
<p>“We believe ADM has made significant progress in ensuring business continuity in an increasingly fragile ecosystem by having a clear outlook on key areas needing protection across its supply chain,” said Peter van der Werf, Head of Engagement at Robeco. “Importantly, the assessment allows ADM to prioritize already degraded land fit for further agricultural expansion, allowing it to steer investments and help farmers to move forward in a sustainable manner.”</p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495; Annie Sanders, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 14, 2024</strong> – A noteworthy 11.6% of independent Tyson Foods* shareholders voted in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal urging the company to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains by 2025. Independent shareholders include all shares that are not held by Tyson Limited Partnership or Tyson’s directors or executive officers.</p>
<p>“Independent shareholders have sent a strong message that Tyson can’t put deforestation on the back burner,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. “Tyson should step up to the plate and make sure its meat doesn’t come with a side of forest destruction.”</p>
<p>The pace of deforestation broke records in 2023 in the Brazilian Cerrado, the world&#8217;s most biologically rich savanna, surging by nearly 45% since 2022. To produce its extensive line of meat products, Tyson Foods buys ingredients from countries around the world, including from high-risk regions such as Brazil where cattle ranching is the largest driver of <a href="https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/brasil/tnc-execs-environmentalframeworkcattle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Tyson’s Deforestation Goals Fall Short</strong></span></p>
<p>Tyson aims to achieve a deforestation-free beef supply chain by the end of 2028 and to eliminate deforestation in its soy and palm oil supply chains by 2030. These goals fall 3-5 years short of recommendations from standard-setting bodies that have concluded that companies can’t hit their climate targets without eliminating deforestation by <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors/forest-land-and-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025</a>.</p>
<p>Tyson also lags peers including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-hormel-foods-commits-to-no-deforestation-by-2025/">Hormel Foods</a>* and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/processed-food-giant-conagra-to-eliminate-deforestation-from-its-supply-chains/">Conagra</a>*, both of which recently pledged to be deforestation-free by 2025.</p>
<p>“This vote demonstrates a growing understanding among investors that deforestation in Tyson’s supply chain exposes the company to material risks,” said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “We urge the company to take investor concern seriously and accelerate progress toward zero-deforestation.”</p>
<p>The Tyson family’s control of Class B shares means it holds up to 70% of the voting rights at the <a href="https://www.pionline.com/governance/new-york-state-common-challenges-tysons-dual-share-stock-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company</a>. The support from independent shareholders is approximate and was calculated under the assumption that Tyson insiders, Tyson Limited Partnership, Tyson’s directors, and executive officers voted against the proposal.</p>
