<p><strong>Boston, April 24, 2025 – </strong>6.4% of the Chemours Company’s* voting shareholders supported a resolution on Tuesday asking the company to adopt a policy to assess biodiversity impacts before mining in ecologically sensitive areas. Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, and the Felician Sisters of North America filed the proposal.</p>



<p>“Chemours should more thoroughly assess biodiversity risks before they can’t turn back the clock,” <strong>said Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>. “Since Chemours mines near ecological gems such as the Okefenokee Swamp, taking extra care to prevent irreversible damage to nature is a no-brainer.”</p>



<p>Chemours, which DuPont spun off in 2015, manufactures and sells “performance chemicals,” including titanium dioxide, a common whitener in products from toothpaste to sunscreen. Most of Chemours’ mining operations are in the North American Coastal Plain, a <a href="https://www.cepf.net/our-work/biodiversity-hotspots/north-american-coastal-plain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global biodiversity hotspot</a>, where mining-related impacts such as lowered groundwater levels, water pollution and habitat degradation would be particularly destructive.</p>



<p><strong>Mining in ecologically sensitive areas can drive biodiversity loss and climate change</strong></p>



<p>Overwhelming scientific consensus indicates that mining near the Okefenokee would significantly damage the swamp by drawing down its water level, tripling the frequency of drought and increasing the risk of <a href="https://www.fws.gov/story/2024-04/faq-okefenokee-nwr-and-twin-pines-mine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildfires</a>. These repercussions would destroy swamp wildlife habitat, damage thousands of acres of adjacent private timberland and release millions of tons of climate-warming <a href="https://garivers.org/protectokefenokee-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions</a>.</p>



<p>“Habitat loss affects not only the land and its inhabitants but also the people who depend on the natural resources,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.felician.org/2020/10/28/sister-mary-jean-sliwinski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Sister Jean Sliwinski</strong></a><strong>, Province Sustainability Coordinator for the Felician Sisters of North America.</strong> “A broader, more long-term approach to assessing potential mining impacts is vital.”</p>



<p>Chemours doesn’t currently assess potentially irreversible biodiversity impacts from its mining operations, lagging a number of peers that do. The company also has a checkered environmental track record that has cost it nearly $1 billion since 2015 for various violations and <a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/?company_op=starts&amp;company=chemours&amp;offense_group=environment-related+offenses&amp;agency_code=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spills</a>. The recently voted-on proposal argued that an enhanced biodiversity assessment policy would reduce systemic, financial and competitive risks for the company.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone would say that slightly whiter toothpaste is worth irreversible biodiversity loss,” <strong>said Green Century Director of Shareholder Advocacy </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “We&#8217;ll keep pressing Chemours to ensure that it considers and protects biodiversity before mining starts. That’s what’s best for investors, customers, and the planet.”</p>

<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>9. Pressing tech companies to curb emissions.</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>While IBM* has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-31-of-ibm-shareholders-support-green-century-climate-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</a></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>7.

In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Chemours &#8211; the DuPont chemical company spinoff &#8211; agreed in 2022 to not buy titanium sourced from mines adjacent to the Okefenokee. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/investors-call-on-chemours-to-stay-out-of-the-okefenokee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century continued to press Chemours in 2024 to make that commitment permanent.</a> </span></span></p>

Other mutual funds in the responsible investing space had followed Green Century’s lead but now are backtracking.

<p>Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, <a href="mailto:tpeterson@greencentury.com">asanders@greencentury.com</a>, 773-272-6691</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, March 27, 2024</strong> – The Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that shareholder proposals seeking protections for the Okefenokee swamp from a titanium mine can be excluded from voting at the 2024 annual meetings of The Chemours Company, Sherwin-Williams and Home Depot. The proposals were filed by Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, and the Felician Sisters of North America.</p>
<p>“While we are disappointed that these companies chose to challenge our proposals rather than evaluate scientifically supported protections for the Okefenokee, we were pleased to learn they have no near-term plans or intent to support mining at this natural treasure,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “As a massive carbon sink and one of the world’s largest intact freshwater <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wetlands</a>, the Okefenokee is the last place we should be mining for anything.”</p>
<p>Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015, manufactures and sells “performance chemicals,” including titanium dioxide. In 2022, Chemours publicly pledged to avoid mining at, or buying minerals from, the swamp in the near term. Following that commitment, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211206005266/en/Hyperion-Signs-MoU-With-Chemours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a long-term contract</a> to secure titanium dioxide from a Tennessee mine which, combined with its other operations in Georgia and Florida, appears to provide a long-term supply.</p>
<p>Sherwin-Williams is a global leader in paints and coatings, and Home Depot is a major carrier of titanium dioxide-based paint. Headquartered in Atlanta, Home Depot’s resistance to protecting a natural resource special to customers, employees, and other stakeholders raises particular concern.</p>
<p>“We will remain steadfast in our commitment to work to protect the Okefenokee,” shared Sister Jean Sliwinski, Sustainability Coordinator, Felician Sisters of North America. “We urge Chemours, Home Depot and Sherwin Williams to strengthen their commitments and help protect this international treasure by publicly pledging to permanently avoid Okefenokee titanium.”</p>
<p><strong>Draft Permits Issued Last Month, Moving Mine Forward</strong></p>
<p>Draft <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife." target="_blank" rel="noopener">permits</a> to allow Twin Pines Minerals, LLC to mine titanium on Trail Ridge, the line of inland sand dunes that help hold water in the Okefenokee, were issued last month by Georgia regulators, putting it on the cusp of approval after a five-year battle. The company has also <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/the-fight-over-a-mine-planned-on-the-okefenokee-swamps-edge-may-have-only-just-begun/5UJMY6PHQFBMXE6TFVHLYKJHJU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicated it has plans to expand to mine more land on the swamp’s edge in the future</a>.</p>
<p>Scientific consensus indicates that Twin Pines’ project would <a href="https://www.wabe.org/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly damage the Okefenokee</a> by drawing down its water level while raising drought and fire risks. Such events could destroy swamp wildlife habitat, damage thousands of acres of adjacent private timberland, and release significant carbon emissions.</p>
<p>“Mining near an ecological gem to make white paint is rife with risks,” said Annie Sanders, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “The absurdity of the prospect would be laughable if it weren’t so shocking that companies actually want to leave this door open.”</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://www.wabe.org/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 comments</a> were submitted to Georgia’s Environmental Protection Division opposing TPM’s draft Mining Land Use Plan in early 2023, and in early March 2024, 100 people testified against mining at a public hearing held by that agency. Because of its conservation and cultural importance, Okefenokee is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/okefenokee-wildlife-refuge-unesco-world-heritage-site-499cd975a576658966f7abef26dbba1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being nominated</a> for inclusion on UNESCO’s World Heritage Site List. In addition, the Okefenokee also stores over 400M tons of CO2 equivalent, making it one of the largest natural carbon sinks in North America.</p>
