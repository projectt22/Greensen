<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="387" height="258" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-24051" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1.jpg 387w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alain_rieder?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alain Rieder</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/black-whale-W3uctt_p_os?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>9. Pressing tech companies to curb emissions.</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>While IBM* has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-31-of-ibm-shareholders-support-green-century-climate-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</a></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>8. <span style="font-size: 17.897px;">Providing client-ready issue impact reports </span></strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br>Green Century has created and shared 15 client-ready Issue<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Impact Reports</a> for you or if you are a financial professional, to share with clients.

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>7. Protecting rare natural spaces</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br><span style="font-size: 17.897px;">Chemours*: The Okefenokee is one of the largest freshwater wetlands in the world, a massive carbon sink, and home to over 1,000 species of plants and animals. In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Chemours &#8211; the DuPont chemical company spinoff &#8211; agreed in 2022 to not buy titanium sourced from mines adjacent to the Okefenokee. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/investors-call-on-chemours-to-stay-out-of-the-okefenokee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century continued to press Chemours in 2024 to make that commitment permanent.</a> </span></span></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. <span style="font-size: 17.897px;">Unwavering commitment to fossil fuel free funds</span></strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century</a> helped lead the fossil fuel free investing movement so individuals have the opportunity to invest without supporting the industry that has driven climate change.  Other mutual funds in the responsible investing space had followed Green Century’s lead but now are backtracking. You can count on Green Century to remain steadfast in its opposition to coal, oil, gas and other environmentally dangerous industries including nuclear power. </span></p>

<div><b>Spotlight on disclosure</b></div>

					<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Choice Hotels International*, one of the world&#8217;s leading lodging franchisors, has agreed to take the first step in addressing plastic pollution by conducting a program measure single-use plastic and develop strategies for single-use plastic reduction after engagement by Green Century°.</p>
<p>Choice Hotels, which has a diverse portfolio of 22 brands including Comfort Inn, Cambria Hotels, and Econo Lodge, will conduct a plastics reduction inventory program in 2024 and use it to set a new goal to reduce single-use plastic next year.</p>
<p>“As investors learn that plastic used for a minute can pollute our environment for hundreds of years, it has become a risk that companies need to manage,” said<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</a>. “We welcome Choice Hotel’s move to set a new plastic reduction goal.”</p>
<h4><strong>Choice Hotels, On of The Leading Lodging Franchisors, Agrees to Single-Use Plastic Study, Reduction</strong></h4>
<p>Choice Hotel’s commitment comes as consumers, investors, and regulators increasingly focus on the negative impacts of single-use plastic on the planet. According to a recent survey, 80% of U.S. respondents from across the political spectrum support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic.</p>
<p>“Delighting guests and reducing single-use plastics are clearly compatible,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</a>. “Customers want hospitality that doesn’t compromise the beauty of the places they might have traveled thousands of miles to visit.”</p>
<h4>It is estimated that two garbage trucks worth of plastic enter the ocean every minute.</h4>
<p>Recycling, long touted as the solution to the plastic waste crisis, has resulted in only 9% of plastic being recycled. Scientists and experts agree that the best way to reduce plastic pollution is to cut the amount of plastic companies are producing, and to replace non-essential single-use plastic with tested alternatives like reuseable containers.</p>
<p>“Choice is taking the first steps in addressing plastic pollution by better understanding how and how much plastic is used for its hotels,” added Guernsey. “The next step is to implement reductions, which will return long term value to consumers, the business, and investors.&#8221;</p>
