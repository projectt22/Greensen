<p><strong>Boston, May 16, 2025</strong> – Chubb’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century° shareholder proposal calling for the company to disclose the climate emissions associated with its investing, underwriting and insuring activities. 13.9% of shareholders cast their votes in favor of the proposal. Chubb is one of the<a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/chubb/67002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> largest publicly traded property and casualty insurers</a>, operating in 55 countries across the globe.</p>



<p>“Investors deserve to know how Chubb’s emissions are driving the climate risks disrupting its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “It’s absurd for Chubb to underwrite activities that cause climate change and then turn around and pay for the claims and payouts caused by these activities.”</p>



<p><a></a>As climate change intensifies, <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/01/09/807524.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurers are increasingly on the hook</a> after more frequent and severe natural disasters. At the same time, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-01-31/insurance-companies-fossil-fuel-industry-eaton-palisades-fire-essential-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many continue to insure fossil fuel projects</a> that exacerbate the losses from those events. Many major insurance companies such as <a href="https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allianz</a> and <a href="https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:52d75760-2c43-4d96-be2f-0514382ac51a/2023-sustainability-report-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Re</a>* have begun disclosing the emissions associated with their fossil fuel clients, increasing transparency on their role in intensifying the climate crisis.</p>



<p><strong>Chubb insures climate risks</strong></p>



<p>Last year’s wildfires in Los Angeles and destructive hurricane season in the Atlantic have sparked concern about a climate-driven insurance crisis. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 had the most billion-dollar climate-related disasters</a> in one year. Insurance companies are increasingly unable to withstand growing losses without raising prices or reducing coverage in high-risk areas.</p>



<p>Chubb has noticed the impact of climate change on its bottom line. Following an estimated <a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/chubb-estimates-1-5bn-loss-from-la-wildfires-amid-reduced-california-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 billion dollars in losses</a> from the 2024 California fires, Chubb’s Chief Executive Evan Greenberg warned: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pricier-insurance-makes-sense-as-climate-risk-grows-chubb-ceo-says-5e5d53b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The cost of climate change, to state the obvious: Going up.”</a></p>



<p>“The companies that are supposed to protect us from the consequences of climate change are also fueling its disastrous effects,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Chubb reporting the emissions from its underwriting, investing, and insuring would demonstrate accountability and an intent to reduce its climate impact.”</p>

					<p><strong>Boston, May 17, 2024</strong>  – Chubb* investors cast 28% of votes in favor of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896159/000110465924041810/tm2327870d7_def14a.htm#tAI11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shareholder proposal</a> filed by Green Century<em>°</em> and the As You Sow Foundation Fund asking the company to disclose climate emissions associated with its insurance and investment activities.</p>
<p>For the past two years, Chubb has fought similar resolutions that also sought comprehensive and detailed emissions reporting.</p>
<p>Chubb is the largest publicly-traded commercial property and casualty insurance company in the world. The company insures companies that drill for oil and gas, operate oil pipelines, and build liquified natural gas terminals, including in <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/risk-exposure-the-insurers-backing-the-lng-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communities on the Gulf Coast of the United States</a>. Chubb had previously insured the infamous <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trans Mountain tar sands pipeline in Canada,</a> which transports crude oil and tar sands oil from landlocked Alberta to Canada’s Pacific Coast. Producing tar sands fuel is <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_shale_and_tar_sands/#:~:text=As%20with%20oil%20shale%2C%20once,usable%20as%20a%20fuel%20source.&amp;text=Producing%20oil%20from%20shale%20or,dirtier%20than%20the%20dirtiest%20coal." target="_blank" rel="noopener">even dirtier than coal</a>.</p>
<p>“At a time when the heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes related to climate change are increasing, Chubb, at the very least, should keep investors informed about the risks they face from the emissions its insurance and investments enable,&#8221; said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “If a global insurance company with the sharpest actuaries can’t begin to measure and report this data, then that should worry all of us.”</p>
<p><strong>Chubb Conflicted About Climate Change</strong></p>
<p>Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg has stressed that Chubb works to support industries that either help business and individuals reduce their carbon footprints or to create new technologies that produce carbon-free energy. In the company&#8217;s 2023 annual report, Chubb acknowledged that climate change-fueled severe weather and natural catastrophes may have challenged its profitability. Chubb also made headlines in late 2021, when it decided to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wildfire-risk-in-california-drives-insurers-to-pull-policies-for-pricey-homes-11642593601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull homeowners insurance coverage</a> in wildfire prone areas of California.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Chubb ranks <a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/IOF-2023-Scorecard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4<sup>th</sup> on the Insure Our Future’s 2022 list of top fossil fuel insurers in the world,</a> and is a <a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key insurer of Brazil’s national oil company</a>, which directs exploratory and ongoing drilling in some of the world’s most sensitive ecological sites around the Great Amazon Reef and along Brazil’s coastline.</p>
<p>“As investors, we know there are short-term rewards for providing insurance to fossil fuel interests,” commented Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “However, the long-term consequences of short-term decisions is what we’re concerned about. Climate change has a very long tail, and we want insurers to prevent, not worsen, this looming threat.”</p>

					<p><b>Media Contacts:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, May 2, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gcchubb032723-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In March giving Chubb Limited permission to block Green Century Funds’ </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shareholder proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal requests Chubb adopt a policy for the time-bound phase out of underwriting new coal, oil, and gas projects. Green Century</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed a similar proposal in 2022, asking for an immediate cessation of underwriting new projects. Chubb challenged last year’s proposal, but, at that time, the SEC ruled the proposal could appear on Chubb’s 2022 ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chubb is the largest publicly-traded property and casualty insurance company and is actively involved in underwriting oil and gas project risks. For example, Chubb has previously underwritten policies for controversial fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Trans Mountain pipeline. A 2022 report exposed Chubb as a major underwriter of liability and transportation risks for offshore oil drilling operations for Petrobras – Brazil’s national oil company – which has the </span><a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fifth largest oil and gas expansion plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any oil and gas company in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re disappointed that Chubb did not want its shareholders to vote on this issue and that the SEC supported Chubb’s argument, claiming that our proposal requires shareholders to ‘probe too deeply’ into Chubb’s core business. We think shareholders understand insurance is essential for coal, oil and gas companies, and many do not believe increasingly expensive drilling and its associated emissions are good for business,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve asked Chubb to phase out insurance for new projects that will likely create decades of greenhouse gas  emissions. It’s hard to square how Chubb enables carbon pollution while simultaneously issuing policies to protect people’s homes and businesses from the impacts of climate change.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the SEC’s ruling, Chubb had announced </span><a href="https://about.chubb.com/#:~:text=Chubb%20is%20the%20world&#039;s%20largest,health%20insurance%2C%20reinsurance%20and%20life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new underwriting criteria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for oil and gas extraction projects requiring existing clients to reduce methane emissions. Additionally, Chubb said it would no longer provide coverage for oil and gas projects in state- or nationally-designated protected areas and in certain other conservation areas. Green Century Funds welcomed action but also </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-chubb-announces-new-policy-to-restrict-its-underwriting-of-oil-and-gas-sector-green-century-seeks-details-on-how-effectively-it-will-reduce-carbon-emissions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critiqued the new policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicating that its potential for reducing greenhouse emissions was unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For two years, we have been pressing Chubb to uphold its duty to protect its shareholders and customers from climate risk,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We believe helping the fossil fuel industry is completely contrary to its fiduciary and prudential responsibilities. These actions aid and abet an industry that has done the most to contribute to a warming planet. Insurers like Chubb have to show more leadership because they are on the front lines of experiencing climate risk.”</span></p>

<p><strong>Boston, February 22, 2023</strong> &#8211; In response to Green Century<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i> re-filing of a shareholder proposal in December, Chubb Limited, the world’s largest commercial property and casualty insurer, has once again asked the SEC for permission to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block the proposal</a> from its proxy ballot. In 2022, Green Century filed a virtually identical <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">proposal</a> asking the company to stop underwriting new coal, oil and methane gas projects. The SEC denied Chubb’s request. Subsequently, the proposal went to a vote at Chubb’s 2022 annual general meeting and garnered the support of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb/">19.4% of the shareholder votes cast</a>.</p>
<p>Like most U.S. property and casualty insurers, Chubb lags behind its European peers in adopting meaningful exclusions. Despite the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and constraints on fossil fuel supply,<a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/worlds-largest-reinsurer-announces-major-new-oil-and-gas-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">  </a>a number of European property and casualty insurers now exclude more oil and methane gas development in their fossil fuel underwriting.  By contrast, in January 2022, a global NGO insurance campaign identified Chubb as a major underwriter of South American offshore oil and gas drilling projects, providing Brazil’s national oil company coverage for 60% of its general civil liability and 50% of its transport-related risks. This state-owned Brazilian company has the fifth-largest documented oil and gas expansion plans of any oil and gas company in the world.</p>
<p>“It boggles the mind to think that an insurance company would willingly create risk for itself and its shareholders by supporting new fossil fuel supply,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “We have to transition away from fuels that create carbon pollution and drive global warming. And let me be clear: We’re not asking Chubb to summarily cancel existing contracts. We’re asking Chubb to be more forward-thinking about a slice of its business and phase out of underwriting new fossil fuel projects. It’s a low bar to clear considering the existential risk of climate change.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chubb argued to the SEC</a> that Green Century’s proposal should be excluded because it probes too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.</p>
<p>“Chubb’s argument seems to underestimate the intelligence of its shareholders,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “I’m sure many are able to come to the fairly obvious conclusion that insurance policies enabling new coal, oil and gas supplies are fueling increasingly severe climate change impacts. It’s not rocket science.”</p>

<p>Media Contacts: Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813; Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, <a href="mailto:markm@greencentury.com">markm@greencentury.com</a>, 678-427-1671</p>



<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2022 – </strong>Voting results are in for two Green Century<em>°</em> shareholder proposals filed with The Hartford and Chubb insurance companies. Green Century filed virtually the same proposal with each company asking them to abide by climate science and stop underwriting fossil fuel expansion. Through filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the companies disclosed that 8.8% and 19.4% of votes cast, respectively, were in favor of the proposal. </p>



<p>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich reacted to the news by saying, “We’re pleased with the vote on the first year of these proposals, which signals that shareholders understand that insuring new fossil fuel development may be bad for business. We believe that underwriting more development of coal, oil and gas &#8212; products whose emissions drive climate change &#8212; while simultaneously collecting premiums from customers who seek protection from climate change, is fundamentally incompatible.”</p>



<p>As of 2020, Chubb was the largest commercial property and casualty insurer in the world; The Hartford ranked 8th. Both are believed to offer significant coverage to the fossil fuel industry, and a recent publication entitled, <a href="https://us.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fueling Climate Change The Insurers Behind Brazil’s Offshore Oil Expansion</a>, reports that Chubb underwrites policies for Brazil’s national oil company, which has the fifth-largest expansion plans of any oil and gas company in the world.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Green Century’s groundbreaking proposals push insurers to change</h2>



<p>Green Century’s groundbreaking proposals ask Chubb and The Hartford to align their underwriting policies with the International Energy Agency’s report, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap</em></a><em>.</em> The Roadmap incorporates the recommendation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change. In addition, the Roadmap also articulates that new fossil fuel development is incompatible with maintaining the 1.5 degree Celsius limit on temperature increase. </p>



<p>“Because insurance companies are at the forefront of managing risk, helping companies whose products are filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases makes no sense,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “We recognize that our proposal is breaking ground by asking for direct changes to Chubb’s and The Hartford’s underwriting strategies for coal, oil and gas projects, and we’re not deterred by the vote result. We’ll continue to engage Chubb and The Hartford and push for a transition away from underwriting fossil fuel expansion. If necessary, we’ll bring the issue in front of shareholders again.”</p>

<p>Media Contacts: Andrea Ranger, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>



<p><strong>Boston, May 18, 2022 – </strong>The Office of the New York State Comptroller, which oversees the $279 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, <a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/common-retirement-fund/corporate-governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a><a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/common-retirement-fund/corporate-governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> in April that it supports the landmark shareholder proposals that Green Century<em>°</em> has filed with Chubb*, Travelers* and The Hartford* &#8212; some of the world’s largest commercial property and casualty insurance companies.</p>



<p>“We very much appreciate that the New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli has thrown his support behind our proposals,” said Green Century’s Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “When managers of large pension funds such as the Common Retirement Fund pre-declare their support, they can sway other big pension funds and asset managers to vote in favor of our proposals.”</p>



<p>Given that the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/deebef5d-0c34-4539-9d0c-10b13d840027/NetZeroby2050-ARoadmapfortheGlobalEnergySector_CORR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap</em></a><em> </em>states that there is no room to develop new fossil fuel supplies and limit global warming, the proposals ask the insurance companies to stop underwriting new fossil fuel supplies. All three insurers asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to block the proposals, but <a href="https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/esg/32969/insurers-chubb-travelers-and-hartford-face-climate-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the SEC rejected</a><a href="https://www.corporatesecretary.com/articles/esg/32969/insurers-chubb-travelers-and-hartford-face-climate-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> their requests</a>.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Green Century asks insurers to align with United Nations’ climate recommendations</h2>



<p>Insurance companies are under increasing pressure to account for their so-called “insured emissions” which are the greenhouse gases emitted by their clients. The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) recently recommended that insurers begin aligning with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#8217;s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The UNEP FI also stated, “the swiftest way to ensure alignment is … to transition fossil fuel-based energy to renewable energy as soon as possible and cease the construction of any new fossil fuel capacities.”</p>



<p>“It’s ironic that insurers are covering heavy emitters including coal, oil, and gas companies whose emissions are contributing to climate change, while simultaneously protecting homeowners and businesses from natural catastrophes that are amplified by climate change,” said Ranger. “We hope that the growing support for our proposals &#8212; from both shareholders and government agencies &#8212; sends a strong signal to companies that it’s time to change. Chubb, Travelers and The Hartford can be part of the solution &#8212; or continue to be part of the problem.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, March 28, 2022 – </strong>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled Monday that Green Centuryº can move forward with a landmark climate proposal at Chubb Limited’s annual meeting in May. This is the first-ever shareholder proposal to go to a vote that asks an insurance company to cease underwriting new fossil fuel supplies in alignment with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) <em>Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I can’t overstate the importance of today’s SEC ruling,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>, shareholder advocate with Green Century.&nbsp; “We can now ask insurance companies to adopt policies that align with the IEA report findings, which we believe makes clear that fossil fuel expansion has no place in a net zero by 2050 future. Insurers like Chubb have enabled the fossil fuel industry to continue business-as-usual which has delayed much-needed adoption of clean energy technologies.”</p>



<p>The ruling follows a policy sea change at the SEC on climate issues. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">In November, the commission announced in a legal bulletin that it would allow shareholders more leeway to ask companies to address climate change and its associated risks</a>. The SEC’s new guidance provides shareholders more influence on the management of climate-related risks and may signal that similar shareholder proposals are poised to survive challenges at the SEC.</p>



<p>Chubb claimed that Green Century’s proposal would interfere with the company’s ability to run its day-to-day business. But reflecting its November guidelines, the SEC affirmed the shareholder right to press companies on broad societal issues such as climate change.</p>



<p>Due to the SEC’s ruling, the similar proposals that Green Century filed with Travelers* and The Hartford* may also go to the ballot.</p>



<p>“I’m elated that our proposal will go to vote,” Ranger said. “Insurers have been saying that underwriting fossil fuels, even new fossil fuel projects, requires a careful, calculated approach. We agree, but they should have started the process years ago. Even the current geo-political conflicts demonstrate how politically charged and risky fossil fuels are, and, in our opinion, is another reason for insurers to walk away.”</p>

<p>By Andrea Ranger</p>



<p>Did you know that the very companies that are supposed to protect us, our families, homes and businesses from fires, hurricanes, floods and hailstorms, are also contributing to climate change?  What kinds of companies, you say? Look no further than your homeowners insurance company. </p>



<p>Most people don’t know that their homeowners insurance company is helping the fossil fuel industry stay afloat. That’s right. Insurance companies such as Travelers,* Chubb,* The Hartford,* Liberty Mutual,* and Berkshire Hathaway* want us to entrust our homes and properties to them while, at the same time, providing insurance coverage to insurance to coal, oil and gas companies.  </p>



<p>It’s hardly a secret that most carbon dioxide emissions come from burning fossil fuels &#8212; roughly 90% per year can be traced back to fossil fuel combustion– and that carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change. Yet insurers continue to underwrite exploring, mining, drilling, refining, and transporting fossil fuels even though doing so threatens our homes, businesses, infrastructure and natural resources. Why would they do this? We’ve wondered the same thing, and, unfortunately, the answer may lie in their business model.</p>



<p>Just like your homeowners insurance policy, many other policies written by insurance companies are renewed on an annual basis. This one-year cycle allows insurers to assess their risks and stay on top of any developing trends. As risks increase in a particular geography or to a certain facility or equipment type, an insurer may decide to increase premiums or terminate policies for certain risky areas or clients.</p>



<p>This makes sense. If insurance companies couldn’t make adjustments to their rates or policies, premiums would increase for all of us, or worse, the companies might not be able to make a profit at all and, as a result, go out of business. </p>



<p>But here’s where their business model becomes problematic. Annual renewals of property and casualty policies can put insurers into a short-term thinking mindset which leads insurance companies to accept perverse risks that may be counter to their long-term financial health. Annual policies allow insurers to walk away from fossil fuel projects before their short-term risk becomes too great, but the future emissions from expanded coal mines, tar sands operations, gas and oil well production, and utility plants will haunt us all long after coal, oil and gas operations become uninsurable. By propping the fossil fuel industry, insurance companies are locking us into a future of climate change.  </p>



<p>But that’s not all. When insurers collect our premiums to cover damage from a falling tree or fire, they don’t just keep that money in a giant piggy bank waiting for the next disaster to strike. They take a portion of the funds and invest it – primarily in stocks and bonds. Unbeknownst to you, some of the stocks and bonds they purchase finance coal, oil and gas projects and is a second way that they are supporting the fossil fuel industry.</p>



<p>The International Energy Agency released a report in May 2021, <em>Net Zero by 2050</em>, stating that to stabilize the climate, there must be no new fossil fuel production. Yet the companies we’ve come to recognize as trustworthy and reliable are not getting the message. For example, Berkshire Hathaway has no policies limiting its underwriting or investment in fossil fuels. The Hartford, Travelers and Chubb have agreed to stop insuring coal operations, but they’ve also carved out exceptions that you could drive a coal-fired locomotive through and have refused to adopt policies excluding new oil or gas supplies. Lax policies are causing shareholders to press these large insurers to stop underwriting fossil fuel expansion, not only for the sake of all stakeholders but for their own future profitability.</p>



<p>Civil society is also taking notice, and activists&#8217; efforts to make the case to insurance companies have been valiant. In addition to protests, petitions and the occasional meeting granted by an insurer, a concerned group gathered at the U.S. Open in New York in September 2021 and inflated a giant likeness to Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg engulfed in flames. They passed out fans to the gathering tennis-watchers with a written admonition to Chubb for financing ‘dirty fossil fuels’. Remarkably, Chubb announced its intention to stop providing insurance to the famous tar sands deliverer – the Trans Mountain pipeline – shortly thereafter. </p>



<p>People shouldn’t have to spend their time and money creating blow up dolls to get their point across. Similarly, investors shouldn’t have to file shareholder proposals with the world’s largest insurance companies to point out that insuring fossil fuel companies is fundamentally incompatible with protecting the rest of their customers. Insurers need to commit to credible, transparent exit strategies from the fossil fuel industry, and they need to do it now. Otherwise, their short-sighted insurance policies will result in long-term damage to the climate, our homes and ourselves.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve global insurers now restrict underwriting conventional oil and gas projects and/or companies, far exceeding the scope of exclusions made by US insurance companies. European insurers, including </span><a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/swiss-re-leads-insurance-exodus-from-oil-and-gas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss Re</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://us.insure-our-future.com/fidelis-becomes-first-north-american-insurer-to-restrict-support-for-the-oil-and-gas-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Munich Re</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/hannover-re-oil-gas-exit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hannover Re</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have been leading the way by announcing oil and gas development-related exclusions despite ongoing fossil fuel supply disruptions caused by geopolitical upheaval. We believe U.S. insurance companies need to follow suit, acknowledge that underwriting risks for the fossil fuel industry creates long lasting climate damage, and shut off the spigot to new oil and gas.</span></p>
