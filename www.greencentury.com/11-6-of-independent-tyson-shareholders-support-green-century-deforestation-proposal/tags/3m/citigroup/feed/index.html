<p><b>Boston, March 30, 2023 – </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citigroup, </span><a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/biggest-banks-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the third largest bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S., followed through on its agreement with Green Century Capital Management° to adopt stronger deforestation policies in its newly released Environmental &amp; Social Policy Statement. The standards were developed after Green Century withdrew its 2022 shareholder proposal in exchange for a commitment from the bank to improve its deforestation policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Neither global climate goals nor companies’ net zero goals can be met without ending deforestation </span><a href="https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/why-net-zero-needs-deforestation-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To do that, we must stop the flow of finance to companies that destroy forests. With these new standards, Citi has become a leading U.S. bank in addressing deforestation exposure in its financing.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Policies apply to industries responsible for most tropical deforestation</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Citi’s new policies apply to the industries responsible for the majority of tropical deforestation: soy, beef, palm oil and forestry. The company has implemented no-deforestation standards for soy clients operating in high-risk regions, instituted a no-deforestation approach for high-risk beef clients, and improved its existing standards for palm oil and forestry clients to align with best practices. </span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Citi’s policies build on landmark agreements in the finance industry</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Citi’s policies build on a landmark agreement in the finance industry that Green Century secured </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with JPMorgan Chase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">* in 2021. JPMorgan became the first U.S. bank to require its palm oil clients to adopt “No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation” (NDPE) policies. Citi’s heightened policies align with this NDPE requirement and expand its scope, while also surpassing JPMorgan with improved forestry sector standards. Notably, Morgan Stanley also </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/morgan-stanley-to-adopt-new-deforestation-policies-in-response-to-green-century-funds-shareholder-proposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similarly committed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to strengthen its deforestation policies in response to a Green Century Funds proposal earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We commend Citi for following through on its commitment to mitigate deforestation risk and protect biodiversity around the world.”</span></p>

<p><strong>Media Contact:</strong> Thomas Peterson, tpeterson@greencentury.com, 781-349-2615</p>



<p><strong>Boston, April 25, 2022 – </strong>Green Century° announced on Monday that it has withdrawn its shareholder proposal for Citigroup’s 2022 annual shareholders meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, April 26, after securing a commitment from the bank to adopt improved deforestation policies.</p>



<p>“We cannot achieve global climate goals without ending deforestation this decade. To do that, we must stop the flow of finance to companies that destroy forests,” said Green Century president Leslie Samuelrich. “Citi’s commitment to expanding its forest protection policies is especially significant, as the bank is among the largest financiers of some of the top sectors abetting deforestation.”</p>



<p>Citi’s new commitments will apply to those industries that are responsible for the majority of tropical deforestation: soy, beef, palm oil and forestry. In exchange for the withdrawal of Green Century’s shareholder proposal, Citi has agreed to adopt no-deforestation standards for soy clients operating in high-risk regions, develop a no-deforestation approach for high-risk beef clients, and improve its existing standards for palm oil and forestry clients to align with best practices.</p>



<p>“Banks like Citi cannot credibly achieve their publicly-stated net zero emissions goals without ending financing for companies that drive deforestation,” said Green Century shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson. “With these new commitments, Citi will become the leading U.S. bank when it comes to addressing deforestation exposure in its financing. That’s an important step toward Citi aligning its forest policies with its climate ambitions.”</p>



<p>This commitment from Citi builds on a landmark agreement that Green Century secured <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">with JPMorgan Chase</a>* last year, when JPMorgan became the first American bank to require its palm oil clients to adopt “No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation” (NDPE) policies. Citi will align with this NDPE policy and expand its scope, while also surpassing JPMorgan with improved forestry sector standards – notably requiring best-practice Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification for clients in tropical forests – and with a no-deforestation approach for beef clients.</p>



<p>First Affirmative Financial Network co-filed the Citi proposal with Green Century.</p>



<p>“While Citi still has work to do to ensure that its clients are not driving deforestation, we are encouraged by the steps that the bank is taking to address these risks,” said Holly Testa, Director of Shareowner Engagement for First Affirmative.</p>



<p>Deforestation is responsible for approximately 15% of global emissions, making it the second leading cause of climate change. In addition to exacerbating the climate crisis, deforestation accelerates biodiversity loss, undermines healthy ecosystems, and plays an active role in the spread of infectious diseases.</p>



<p>In 2020, the <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/ca8642en/ca8642en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Food and Agriculture Organization</a> <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/ca8642en/ca8642en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> that deforestation and forest degradation are taking place at “alarming rates.” A total of 1,621,629 square miles of forest, an area larger than India, has been cleared since 1990, mostly for agricultural expansion.</p>



<p><p>Green Century Capital Management is one of the foremost North American investors engaging companies on risks related to deforestation. Green Century has worked with dozens of corporations to mitigate their exposure to forest-related risks and secured some of the earliest corporate no-deforestation commitments.
