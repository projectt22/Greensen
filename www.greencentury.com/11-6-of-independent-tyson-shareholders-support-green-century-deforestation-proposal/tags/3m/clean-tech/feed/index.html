<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, </span><a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aranger@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 781-349-2813;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, </span><a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ppodger@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>BOSTON, April 26, 2023 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– After filing shareholder proposals with each company, Green Century° successfully secured commitments with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.,* Intel Corporation,* NVIDIA Corporation,*  ON Semiconductor Corporation,* and Texas Instruments, Inc.* requesting they publish climate transition plans. Climate transition plans detail companies&#8217; near- and medium-term strategies and future actions deemed necessary to reaching their greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations describes such plans as an “</span><a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/high-level_expert_group_n7b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essential tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” for building public trust, helping companies align “governance and incentive structures, capital expenditures, research and development, skills and human resource development, and public advocacy…” with their targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressure to plan for and achieve steep emissions cuts comes not only from investors, but from the semiconductor industry itself. The Semiconductor Climate Consortium, which is an initiative of  the microelectronics industry group SEMI, urges its members to set net-zero emissions targets and to transparently report progress. Additionally, semiconductor company customers that have net-zero emissions reduction targets, such as Apple,* Google,* and Microsoft,* are increasingly eyeing their chip suppliers as they look to eliminate their upstream emissions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Climate Transition Plans Help Investors Assess Companies’ Progress In Limiting Climate Change</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe each company recognizes the value of producing climate transition plans for investors and that their leadership will encourage peers and competitors to do the same,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Investors increasingly need visibility into companies’ assumptions, opportunities, barriers, and emissions reduction pathways as they move toward fulfilling their emissions reduction targets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semiconductor chip manufacturing is energy intensive and relies heavily on electricity to power furnaces, manufacturing equipment, and to maintain clean rooms. As a result, companies like Intel, NVIDIA, and ON Semiconductor are looking to source 100% renewable energy for their operations.  However, semiconductor manufacturing also uses gases that are essential  to completing chip designs, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs). PFCs have a global warming potential that is thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide, and the gases are currently much more difficult to replace with less potent alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The semiconductor industry has some very real challenges to overcome in order to secure a path to net-zero emissions,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger, “The idea of climate transition plans is relatively new, but for Green Century, they couldn’t come quickly enough. The window of time for limiting devastating climate impacts is so narrow; we need to know that companies are planning and doing their part to ensure a livable future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranger added, “I want to acknowledge Advanced Micro Devices and ON Semiconductor, especially, for agreeing to create the most comprehensive transition plans I’ve seen yet. All five companies, however, deserve praise for their new commitments.” </span></p>
