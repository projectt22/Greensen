<p><strong>Boston, May 07, 2025</strong> – Shareholders sent a nature-positive message to PepsiCo* on Wednesday in response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century Capital Management. The proposal asked the company to assess its impact on nature and the systemic risks posed to the company by those impacts on the world around us.</p>



<p>“PepsiCo relies on nature for all the ingredients that go into its products, from corn and spices to fresh water,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company needs to do everything possible to ensure it’s not hurting healthy ecosystems. That will help reduce PepsiCo’s potential nature-related risks.”</p>



<p><strong>The natural world under pressure</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwcboosts-global-nature-and-biodiversity-capabilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half of global GDP </a>is dependent on natural inputs. Yet, the reliability of these inputs is increasingly uncertain. The United States incurred more than <a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-20-billion-question-hanging-over-americas-struggling-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 billion in crop losses last year because of extreme weather</a>. In addition, the global decline in pollinators has destabilized crop yields across two-thirds of the world. The <a href="https://octopart.com/pulse/p/extreme-weather-becomes-new-supply-chain-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disruption of nature </a>also impacts the <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transportation systems </a>that companies such as PepsiCo use to bring products to market. In 2024, wildfires, hurricanes and floods <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/weathers-wrath-supply-chains-reel-from-2024s-extreme-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down transport systems around the globe</a>, causing major disruptions in Canada, Mexico, China and Malaysia, among other places.</p>



<p><strong>Investors want transparency re: Pepsi’s impacts on nature</strong></p>



<p>This is the second year that Green Century has offered PepsiCo’s shareholders a proposal on biodiversity impacts. This year’s proposal was supported by 17.7% of PepsiCo shareholders. This vote will allow the resolution to be submitted again next year if the company does not take action. </p>



<p>“We hope that PepsiCo will hear the message of its shareholders: nature matters,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“Investors shouldn’t have to stay up at night wondering whether our company is putting critical ecosystems at risk to sell Doritos and Mountain Dew.”</p>

					<p><strong>BOSTON &#8212; </strong>VF Corporation*, the parent company of <em>The </em><em>North Face</em><em>®,</em><em> Vans</em><em>®</em>, and <em>Timberland</em><em>®</em> brands, will take steps to further address microfiber pollution from its clothes after engagement with Green Century° and As You Sow. The company has joined the “<a href="https://www.microfibreconsortium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Microfibre Consortium</a>” at the enterprise level where it will collaborate with industry leaders to develop plans to improve testing, research, and data on microfiber pollution.</p>
<p>Also known as fiber shedding, microfiber pollution results from the manufacture and washing of clothes, which release tiny fiber threads. Microfiber pollution is particularly concerning for synthetic textiles, like polyester and acrylic.</p>
<p>Synthetic textiles produce an estimated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/reduce-laundry-microfiber-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35%</a> of the microplastic pollution in the world’s oceans.</p>
<p>“Clothes made from synthetic materials release thousands of microplastics with each wash and pollute our waterways,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Companies should tell consumers which of their products produce high amounts of microfiber pollution and reduce microfiber pollution in their supply chains.”</p>
<p>Textiles are the third-largest market for plastics and consume nearly 15% of total plastic <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/NOAA-NOS-2022-0061-0002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">production</a>.</p>
<p>The Microfibre Consortium is working with policymakers, suppliers and brands to reduce the environmental impacts of Microfiber pollution. The organization is creating a rating system for textiles, which is anticipated to launch in 2025.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that the company has agreed to consider setting a companywide microfiber shedding reduction goal after the consortium rating system is completed,” <strong>said Conrad MacKerron, Senior Vice President, As You Sow</strong>.</p>
<p>Regulation on Microfiber pollution is likely to increase. An “<a href="https://docs.score-environnemental.com/v/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eco-Score</a>” system in France will use microfiber pollution as one of the metrics for scoring clothing sustainability. One competitor, Under Armour, has already committed to transition to more <a href="https://about.underarmour.com/en/stories/2023/02/under-armour-announces-new-methodology-to-measure-fiber-shedding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Low shed” materials by 2030.</a></p>
<p>“We encourage all clothing companies to disclose more information about which of their products are likely to shed microfibers,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “Consumers want to make informed decisions, but that isn’t possible if they don’t have access to basic information.”</p>
