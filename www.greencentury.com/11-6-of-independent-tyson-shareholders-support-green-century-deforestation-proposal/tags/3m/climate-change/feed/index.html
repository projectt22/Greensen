<p><strong>Boston, June 26, 2025</strong> – Conagra Brands*, the parent company of Orville Redenbacher’s, Duncan Hines, Slim Jim and other well-known food brands will assess whether it should replicate the nature and biodiversity protections it employs in forests in non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco in Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.</p>



<p>“Food companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It’s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.”</p>



<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat</strong></p>



<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina. The Cerrado alone, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% of all species</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on Earth, has lost </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million acres of natural savanna</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in recent decades</a>. This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.</p>



<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection</strong></p>



<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company’s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;It’s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, June 20, 2025 – The Conservation Fund announced Friday that it had purchased land and mineral rights near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge from Twin Pines Minerals, LLC. The mining [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p><strong>Boston, June 20, 2025 – </strong><a href="https://www.conservationfund.org/our-impact/press-room/the-conservation-fund-halts-okefenokee-mining-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Conservation Fund</a> announced Friday that it had purchased land and mineral rights near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge from Twin Pines Minerals, LLC. The mining company had proposed a strip mine roughly three miles from the edge of the Okefenokee, the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/okefenokee/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest National Wildlife Refuge in the eastern</a> United States. </p>



<p>The proposed titanium mine could have contaminated Georgia’s most famous swamp,&nbsp;threatened the biodiversity-rich ecosystem, and <a href="https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Letter_RD%20to%20GA-EPD_TwinPines%20Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heightened the chances of wildfires.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For four years,<strong> </strong>Green Century° has pressed companies to avoid mining or selling products containing materials mined at the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Twin Pines’ move to sell this land only reinforces our position that mining at the Okefenokee quite simply isn’t worth the risks.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a price tag of nearly $60 million, The Conservation Fund will acquire about 8,000 acres of land and the underlying mineral rights from Twin Pines Minerals, which had prior contractual relations with Chemours, located near the swamp that includes a section where the company had proposed a roughly 600-acre titanium mine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>The Okefenokee is a global biodiversity hotspot, freshwater wetland, and carbon sink</strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last fall, Green Century Capital Management and the Felician Sisters of North America Endowment Trust&nbsp;filed a shareholder resolution asking chemical company Chemours* to assess potentially irreversible biodiversity impacts before mining in ecologically sensitive areas, including at the Okefenokee. Most of Chemours&#8217; mining operations lie in a global biodiversity hotspot, where mining-related impacts such as water pollution and habitat degradation are particularly destructive. The proposal received sufficient investor support to refile in future years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As one of the largest freshwater <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wetlands</a> in the world, a massive carbon sink, and home to over 1,000 species of plants and animals, the Okefenokee is the last place we should be mining for anything,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century</strong>. “We applaud today’s news that this national treasure is one step closer to protection from harmful and unnecessary mining.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, June 11, 2025 </strong>– Columbia Sportswear’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century<em>° </em>shareholder proposal requesting that the company set climate emissions reduction targets. The proposal received 7.9% of votes cast.</p>



<p>“Columbia would better serve its investors and bottom line by cutting its climate impact, like so many of its peers have done,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Climate action is a priority for many of Columbia’s outdoorsy customers, so it should be a priority for Columbia.”</p>



<p><a></a>In 2020, the owner of several active lifestyle brands <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/309/columbia-sportswear-company-releases-2020-corporate?ef_id=2efa76054317110b878d1542bfa78f26%3AG%3As" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to cut the climate footprint</a> of its manufacturing by 30%, but the company quietly stopped reporting on its commitment in 2022. Columbia has not indicated that it will adopt a new goal to keep up with the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">649 </a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footwear and apparel companies</a> that have agreed to or already set science-based emissions reduction targets as of May 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Columbia falls behind its mission and peers</strong></p>



<p><a></a>Without action, the footwear and apparel industry by 2050 could account for <a href="https://content.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/m/7f818b40f06e1afd/original/Summary-of-findings-A-New-Textiles-Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a quarter</a> of the global climate emissions necessary to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/2024-was-warmest-year-modern-record-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 was the warmest year</a> on record and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/when-risks-become-reality-extreme-weather-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists say</a> climate change added 41 days of dangerous heat and worsened the severity of flooding.</p>



<p>Consumer concern about climate change is rising with the temperature. A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PricewaterhouseCoopers survey</a> found that more than 80% of consumers say they are willing to pay more for sustainably produced goods, and some would be willing to pay 9.7% more for goods that meet environmental standards. Nine out of ten Gen Zers born between 1996 and 2010 believe that companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-gen-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey study</a>.</p>



<p>Columbia’s mission is to “unlock the outdoors for everyone.” Nevertheless, while Columbia stays silent on climate commitments, its competitors &#8212; including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia,</a> <a href="https://www.vfc.com/responsibility/planet/climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VF Corp</a>*, and <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/meet-brooks/running-responsibly/climate-action/?srsltid=AfmBOoqMK8jgLJzsGhpwmQ2R1kjF11jnwNMHvdGvMjxHHUFWqxm91UWJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooks</a> &#8212; have set climate emissions reduction goals that demonstrate they are working to protect the environment their customers value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Columbia <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/372/columbia-sportswear-company-reports-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=our%20conference%20call.-,ACCELERATE%20Growth%20Strategy,as%20enhanced%20ways%20of%20working." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to attract</a> young, active consumers, yet it has backtracked on its ambition to protect the very outdoors they want to experience,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The company could boost its reputation and competitive edge if it took further steps to protect Earth, not just use it in its advertising.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, June 6, 2025 – 13.9% of General Motors Company* (GM) shareholders voted Tuesday in support of Green Century’s° resolution asking the company to reduce climate emissions from its supply [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p><strong>Boston, June 6, 2025 –</strong> 13.9% of General Motors Company* (GM) shareholders voted Tuesday in support of Green Century’s° resolution asking the company to reduce climate emissions from its supply chain. GM&#8217;s supply chain, which includes steel, aluminum and batteries, <a href="https://www.gm.com/content/dam/company/docs/us/en/gmcom/company/GM_2023_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represents 16%</a> of the company’s impact on climate change.</p>



<p>“Investors want to know how General Motors is addressing the climate impact of its supply chain,” <strong>said Green Century Funds president </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “Without a roadmap to cut these emissions, it’s unclear to investors how GM plans to mitigate climate-related risks in line with its zero emissions ambition.”</p>



<p><strong>Steel and aluminum are major climate polluters</strong></p>



<p>The climate impact of GM&#8217;s supply chain mainly comes from materials such as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629622000706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steel</a> and <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/decarbonizing-aluminum-rolling-out-more-sustainable-sector" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aluminum</a>, the production of which is responsible for approximately 10% of global climate emissions. The auto industry is the second-largest consumer of steel, procuring <a href="https://theicct.org/publication/green-steel-automakers-us-europe-sep-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12%</a> of global supply, and is the largest aluminum buyer in the <a href="https://leadthecharge.org/the-problem/aluminum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world</a>. Alternatives such as <a href="https://theicct.org/publication/technologies-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-automotive-steel-US-EU-jul24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low-carbon steel</a> and <a href="https://international-aluminium.org/landing/as-well-as-aluminium-recycling-saving-95-of-the-energy-needed-for-primary-aluminium-production-the-recycling-process-saves-a-similar-percentage-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycled aluminum</a> can reduce climate emissions from each material by over 95%.</p>



<p><strong>GM aims for zero emissions, but lacks a plan for its supply chain</strong></p>



<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/climate-transition-planning#what" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate transition plan</a> should describe the strategies, milestones, and timelines for a company to deliver on its decarbonization targets. It also includes progress reporting. Green Century’s proposal argued that these steps are as necessary for GM&#8217;s supply chain as they are for its other emissions sources.</p>



<p>To achieve zero emissions, GM will need to significantly scale up procurement of low-emissions steel and aluminum from its <a href="https://www.gm.com/content/dam/company/docs/us/en/gmcom/company/GM_2023_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current target</a> of 10% by 2030, among other steps. And while GM has outlined detailed climate emissions reduction efforts for its operations and vehicle use, it hasn’t disclosed similar targets or plans for its supply chain.</p>



<p>GM has taken some steps to cut supply chain emissions, including target-setting requirements for its <a href="https://www.gm.com/content/dam/company/docs/us/en/gmcom/company/GM_2023_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suppliers</a>. However, the largest U.S. auto maker has yet to report on results or incorporate existing steps into a supply chain emissions reduction plan that charts a path to zero emissions.</p>



<p><strong>Competitors are doing more to reduce supply chain emissions</strong></p>



<p>Competitors such as <a href="https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/publications/more/group-sustainability-report-2023-2674" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volkswagen</a> and <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup_com/ir/downloads/en/2025/bericht/BMW-Group-Report-2024-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMW</a> disclose supply chain climate emissions reduction targets and plans, and additional companies including <a href="https://stegra.com/news-and-stories/mercedes-benz-and-h2-green-steel-announce-agreements-in-both-europe-and-north-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercedes</a>, <a href="https://stegra.com/news-and-stories/h2-green-steel-collaborates-with-volvo-group-for-supply-of-near-zero-emissions-steel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volvo</a> and <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2023/sustainability/porsche-co2-reduced-steel-in-sports-cars-34225.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Porsche</a> have locked in supplies of more sustainable steel. GM&#8217;s lack of a plan to fully mitigate its contribution to climate change may harm its image and credibility so as to become a factor in customer purchasing decisions, particularly in Europe.</p>



<p>“It’s time for GM to apply the same rigor to cutting supply chain emissions that it musters for its other business goals,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century.</strong> “Investors expect nothing less from a company that aims to lead the automotive industry in creating a world with zero emissions.”</p>

<p>A shareholder proposal co-filed by Green Century Capital Management called on Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, to conduct a full assessment of its impact on nature and on the risks the company faces from the increasing instability of the natural environment. Company shareholders voted on the proposal at the company’s annual meeting Thursday. The proposal received 17% of votes cast, more than a similar proposal received at the company’s 2024 stockholder meeting.</p>



<p>“Home Depot sells lumber, paints, and herbicides, all of which adversely impact the environment, during either production or use,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company has a responsibility to shareholders and the planet to account for how its business affects nature.”</p>



<p><strong>Investors concerned about the health of the natural world</strong></p>



<p>Climate change, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are stressing the planet. In this context, investors have begun asking companies to fully disclose how their operations, sourcing and sales impact the environment. More than 350 companies have committed to providing a comprehensive accounting of these actions under the <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure</a>.  The proposal co-filed by Green Century asks Home Depot to provide a similar assessment. The initiative was led by Domini Impact Investments and was also supported by Proxy Impact on behalf of the Great Oaks Fund.</p>



<p>University of British Columbia Prof <a href="https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/suzanne-simard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanne Simard</a>, author of <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest</em>, presented the proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. In her remarks, Simard, a professor of forest ecology, described the important role of forests in mitigating climate change and how industrial logging degrades the health of forests. Home Depot sources approximately 17% of its lumber <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the pristine Canadian boreal</a> forests. Studies have documented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe long-term damage</a> from forestry practices in the boreal and how the increasing rate and severity of wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/12/climate/canada-wildfires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hampered the forest’s ability to recover and regrow</a>.</p>



<p>“Home Depot needs to do a better job of taking care of the home we all share: Earth,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“No one’s going to build a new deck when a wildfire’s burning in the back yard.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 14.8% of votes cast on Wednesday supported a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the insurer Markel Group to disclose the climate emissions from its underwriting, investing and insuring activities. The Virginia-based company has grown from <a href="https://www.mklgroup.com/who-we-are/our-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering small buses</a> to insuring a range of properties from boats to <a href="https://www.markel.com/international/london/energy/downstream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oil refineries</a> over its 95 years of operation.  </p>



<p>“Insurers’ pursuit of short-term profits from fossil fuels guarantees long-term environmental and financial costs,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.&nbsp;</strong> “It makes no sense for any business to willingly and knowingly contribute to something &#8212; in this case, climate change &#8212; that causes such large payouts. Investors deserve to know how Markel’s emissions drive the climate risks its business is losing money from.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/is-climate-change-increasing-the-risk-of-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural disasters increase</a> in frequency and severity due to climate change, so do the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulties insurers face in pricing risk</a> and recovering losses from climate disasters. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2023 <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded $100 billion</a> for the fourth consecutive year and the Swiss Re Group projects they could <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double within the next ten years</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impacts of increasing emissions extend to homeowners as well. Insurers are increasingly abandoning areas vulnerable to climate change-fueled severe weather by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/18/homeowners-insurance-california-florida-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to renew policies</a> at the end of their term. A congressional investigation revealed that climate change has spurred <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiking non-renewal rates</a> by insurers and <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher premiums</a> for customers. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more th</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 counties</a> across the United States, the rate of non-renewal has tripled or more since 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Markel is quiet on climate impact&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a professed <a href="https://www.markel.com/about-us/company-responsibility#5927E3E9394A46A29A73467F1A9B4CA4-tab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to environmental stewardship</a>, Markel does not report any of its climate emissions or publish an annual sustainability report. This places the company far behind competitors including <a href="https://asset.trvstatic.com/download/assets/Travelers_TCFDReport2023.pdf/93114e88b97011efa5e28e42e80f1a8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travelers</a>* and <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIG</a>, both of which disclose their operational emissions and are expanding efforts to measure the emissions associated with their investments. Markel is also out of step with the vast majority of other companies in the Russell 1000 index – which represents the biggest companies in the U.S. – 93% of which published a <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/nc/storage/press-releases/article/ga-institutes-research-shows-2023-sustainability-reporting-at-record-levels-as-us-public-compani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustainability report in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, investors and consumers will foot the bill for Markel’s lack of transparency and failure to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Understanding the scope of Markel’s unwriting, investing and insuring of fossil fuels is the first step in responding to these risks to both pocketbooks and the planet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 – </strong>5.7% of shareholder votes were cast in favor of a shareholder proposal asking Foot Locker* to set climate emissions reduction targets at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. Green Century° and <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a><em> </em>filed the proposal.  </p>



<p>“Without climate targets, investors are in the dark about Foot Locker’s plans to mitigate climate risk,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Setting a goal to cut planet-warming emissions shows that Foot Locker is working to reduce its climate impact, not just measure it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/f4606fc1-6d5b-46c9-b175-2cd50429c30e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker committed</a> to setting climate emissions reduction targets and a net-zero goal in response to an <em>As You Sow </em>shareholder proposal. The company quietly retracted its commitment this year in its <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact report</a> and has not shared plans to adopt new climate targets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Climate change threatens footwear and apparel companies&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Footwear and apparel companies are expected to experience significant impacts as climate change intensifies. Asia is the “<a href="https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/asia-still-garment-factory-world-yet-faces-numerous-challenges-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garment factory of the world</a>,” according to the International Labor Organization, as well as the world’s <a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-asia-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most disaster-prone region</a>. Climate disasters could <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-state-of-fashion-2024-report-climate-crisis-supply-chain-sustainability-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten $65 billion worth of apparel exports</a> from countries critical to footwear and apparel production by 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/node/21641/html#item1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s disclosures</a> warn that climate-related hazards could disrupt production and delivery.

<p><strong>Foot Locker out of step with industry</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six hundred and forty footwear and apparel retailers, such as <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/impact/initiatives/reducing-our-carbon-footprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nike*,</a> <a href="https://sustainability.decathlon.com/what-action-plan-is-needed-to-reduce-absolute-co2-eq-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decathalon</a> and <a href="https://www.jdplc.com/esg/environment/climate-change/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JD Sports</a>, have set or committed to setting science-based targets to reduce their climate emissions and associated risks. <a href="https://earth.org/what-is-the-united-nations-fashion-industry-charter-for-climate-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nearly 130 apparel companies</a> have signed on to the <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/sectoral-engagement-for-climate-action/fashion-charter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Nation’s Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,</a> which requires adopting science-based targets and collaborating on plans to reach them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Foot Locker’s prior pledge recognized the role it can play in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change on its business and the Earth,” <strong>said Danielle Fugere, president and chief counsel of <em>As You Sow</em></strong>. “Recommitting to greenhouse gas reduction targets would allow Foot Locker to address the growing impacts of climate change and better compete with its peers.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 10.5% of McDonald’s* shareholders cast their votes in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to assess whether its existing climate policies and plans are sufficient to achieve its emissions reduction targets. The resolution, which went to the ballot Tuesday, requests details on McDonald’s progress toward reaching its net-zero emissions by 2050 goal</p>



<p>“McDonald’s commitment to reducing carbon pollution shows that the company understands the risks that a warming planet poses to its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Now, McDonald’s must assure investors that it will live up to its commitments and take the necessary steps to meaningfully reduce climate-related risks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef has an outsized climate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/food-systems-responsible-for-one-third-of-human-caused-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our food system</a> accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and few meals we eat contribute to those emissions more than a burger. The life cycle of beef from farm to fork<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emits more greenhouse gas emissions</a> per kilogram than any other food, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular fast-food restaurants can play a key role in addressing climate change by buying and selling beef produced with processes that reduce emissions. Chains including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have added alternative-protein patties to their menus. Diversifying protein options to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption of beef is one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical method to cutting climate emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>McDonald’s </strong><strong>is slow </strong><strong>to show progress&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s set short- and long-term targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with what science says is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Because beef makes up about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/the-carbon-footprint-of-mcdonald-s-menu-very-big" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of the company&#8217;s total climate footprint</a>, reducing beef-related emissions is an impactful strategy to achieve its climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the climate risks of increasing emissions, McDonald’s is exposing itself to reputational risk by failing to illustrate it is on track to meet its climate commitments. <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/greenwashing-rising-report-rep-risk-social-washing-sustainability/696289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental groups </a>have suggested companies, <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/mcdonalds-greenwashing-2655223811.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including McDonald’s</a>, may be misleading customers about the extent of their climate action, a phenomenon called “greenwashing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s has several initiatives to decrease the emissions from beef production. These plans aim to<a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce beef more sustainably</a> and<a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve soil’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide</a>. Still, the company <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/the-mcplant-is-out-but-the-mcrib-will-be-back-heres-when/476654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinued its only plant-based burger</a> in the United States, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its largest </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market</a> in terms of system-wide sales, signaling alternative proteins may not be a part of its approach to cutting climate emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“McDonald’s lacks alternative protein options that would help it reduce its beef-related emissions and demonstrate progress toward achieving its goals,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>hareholder </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>dvocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The happiest meal for investors is one that shows the company is reducing emissions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 </strong>– 5.1% of voting shares were cast on Wednesday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking Wendy’s for more details on how the company will achieve its sustainability goals. The fast food chain has pledged to reduce the climate impact of emissions drivers such as beef production across farms, franchises and other links in its supply chain.</p>



<p>“Investors want to know Wendy&#8217;s has a viable strategy to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Plans that directly address the highest-emitting parts of Wendy’s business are critical to making its climate roadmap a reality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef is a major climate emitter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all the goods Wendy’s purchases, beef is the main offender in increasing emissions. The United Nations reports that beef <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emits</a> more greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram than any other food. <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beef accounts for 58%</a> of the total emissions from the goods and services Wendy’s purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendys-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2023</a>, Wendy&#8217;s announced its first goals to reduce emissions from purchased goods and services and franchises by 2030. Reducing the climate footprint of its “fresh, never frozen” burgers is key to Wendy’s reaching its new, <a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> climate </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targets</a>, and the company identifies <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beef as one of four emissions </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot spots</a>.” Nevertheless, emissions from Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2024-05/Wendys-2023-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased goods and services have increased</a> since 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Wendy’s climate plans lack key details</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wendy’s sustainability report highlights steps to <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve its climate commitment— primarily through increasing innovation</a> rather than decreasing beef consumption. The company cites manure management and feed efficiency as key initiatives to cut emissions but lacks details about how specific projects, collaborations, or investments will make its emissions reduction plans a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Competitors including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have already taken steps that will reduce emissions from beef, such as introducing alternative proteins to their menus. Burger King’s Impossible<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Whopper <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/responsible-sourcing/beef-cow-methane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generates 89% fewer emissions</a> than a beef burger, helping the restaurant reach its own <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/planet/climate-action/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">climate commitment</a>. Although Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features “product mix”</a> as part of its roadmap to reduce emissions, it does not describe what this strategy entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wendy’s ambition to reduce its climate footprint will only benefit its business if it becomes reality,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Investors want to know more details on how the company plans to hit its climate goals.

<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 – </strong>13.9% of shareholder votes Wednesday were cast in favor of a resolution asking Amazon to report the climate emissions from all of its retail sales. Green Century,° along with shareholder representative <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a><em>,</em> filed the resolution with the retail giant on behalf of shareholders.</p>



<p>“Amazon is failing to provide transparent and complete data on its emissions,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Without a clear picture of Amazon’s emissions, investors cannot analyze the company’s climate impact and associated risks.”</p>



<p>Amazon does not report emissions <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with 99% of the company’s retail sales</a><strong><em>.</em></strong> Unlike its peers <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/esgreport/our-esg-priorities/2023%20CDP%20Climate%20Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mobilecontent.costco.com/staging/resource/img/25w03130/5a_ClimateActionPlan_FY24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco</a>* and <a href="https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/c70c48ab-0e10-4576-9e92-789e30665964/2023-CDP-Climate-Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target</a>*, the company only publishes the emissions of its Amazon-branded products, which make up a mere 1% of retail <a href="https://www.momentumcommerce.com/amazons-private-label-market-share-shrinks-by-6-year-over-year-in-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a>.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s emissions disclosures do not align with the global standard for corporate greenhouse gas reporting, which its major peers are following,” <strong>said Parker Caswell, climate and energy senior associate at <em>As You Sow</em>. </strong>&#8220;Amazon must live up to investor expectations and report more than the emissions from products that make up just <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of its sales</a>.”</p>



<p>Despite investor concern, and coming regulations in <a href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/sustainability-reporting-and-auditing-scope-3-supplier-emissions#DoScope3EmissionsNeedToBeReported" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the European Union</a> (EU) and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> that may mandate more detailed disclosures, Amazon has not indicated it will improve its reporting.</p>



<p><strong>Amazon fails to measure up to climate commitments</strong></p>



<p>The retail sector is responsible for <a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-retailer-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% of global greenhouse gas emissions,</a> which means large retailers can play a crucial role in tackling the climate crisis. Amazon recognized this in declaring its <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/planet/climate-pledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious target to cut emissions</a> by 2040, citing the need for meaningful action to halt climate change.</p>



<p>While Amazon has set targets to tackle climate change, it has also faced <a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/why-amazons-own-employees-are-calling-it-out-for-greenwashing-ff7ace354cb7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaints from its employees</a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250314136610/en/Hagens-Berman-Amazon-Faces-Consumer-Lawsuit-Alleging-Deforestation-Behind-Amazon-Basics-Paper-Products-and-Greenwashing-Cover-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal challenges from customers</a> on the accuracy of its climate disclosures and marketing.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s climate mitigation efforts should match the scale of its business, “<strong> said</strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong> </strong></a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“It’s time for Amazon to live up to its own climate ambition and investor expectations for mitigating climate-related risks.”</p>
