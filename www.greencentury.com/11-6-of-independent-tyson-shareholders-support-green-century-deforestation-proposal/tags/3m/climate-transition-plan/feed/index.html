<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 10.5% of McDonald’s* shareholders cast their votes in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to assess whether its existing climate policies and plans are sufficient to achieve its emissions reduction targets. The resolution, which went to the ballot Tuesday, requests details on McDonald’s progress toward reaching its net-zero emissions by 2050 goal</p>



<p>“McDonald’s commitment to reducing carbon pollution shows that the company understands the risks that a warming planet poses to its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Now, McDonald’s must assure investors that it will live up to its commitments and take the necessary steps to meaningfully reduce climate-related risks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef has an outsized climate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/food-systems-responsible-for-one-third-of-human-caused-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our food system</a> accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and few meals we eat contribute to those emissions more than a burger. The life cycle of beef from farm to fork<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emits more greenhouse gas emissions</a> per kilogram than any other food, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular fast-food restaurants can play a key role in addressing climate change by buying and selling beef produced with processes that reduce emissions. Chains including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have added alternative-protein patties to their menus. Diversifying protein options to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption of beef is one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical method to cutting climate emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>McDonald’s </strong><strong>is slow </strong><strong>to show progress&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s set short- and long-term targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with what science says is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Because beef makes up about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/the-carbon-footprint-of-mcdonald-s-menu-very-big" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of the company&#8217;s total climate footprint</a>, reducing beef-related emissions is an impactful strategy to achieve its climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the climate risks of increasing emissions, McDonald’s is exposing itself to reputational risk by failing to illustrate it is on track to meet its climate commitments. <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/greenwashing-rising-report-rep-risk-social-washing-sustainability/696289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental groups </a>have suggested companies, <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/mcdonalds-greenwashing-2655223811.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including McDonald’s</a>, may be misleading customers about the extent of their climate action, a phenomenon called “greenwashing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s has several initiatives to decrease the emissions from beef production. These plans aim to<a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce beef more sustainably</a> and<a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve soil’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide</a>. Still, the company <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/the-mcplant-is-out-but-the-mcrib-will-be-back-heres-when/476654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinued its only plant-based burger</a> in the United States, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its largest </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market</a> in terms of system-wide sales, signaling alternative proteins may not be a part of its approach to cutting climate emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“McDonald’s lacks alternative protein options that would help it reduce its beef-related emissions and demonstrate progress toward achieving its goals,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>hareholder </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>dvocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The happiest meal for investors is one that shows the company is reducing emissions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, August 12, 2024 – In response to a shareholder proposal from United Church Funds, represented by Green Century° and Presbyterian Church, (U.S.A.) as well as dialogue with other stakeholders, [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p></p>



<p><strong>Boston, August 12, 2024</strong> – In response to a shareholder proposal from United Church Funds, represented by Green Century° and Presbyterian Church, (U.S.A.) as well as dialogue with other stakeholders, the American International Group (AIG) <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will publish a roadmap</a> explaining how it will fulfill its climate goals and address climate risk. </p>



<p>While AIG is developing climate transition plans in response to regulatory requirements in international jurisdictions, the climate transition plan it intends to deliver to investors will cover its U.S. business as well. It committed to following the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/blog/emea-centre-for-regulatory-strategy/2023/transition-plan-taskforces-final-disclosure-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transition Plan Taskforce Disclosure Framework</a>, one of the most comprehensive and detailed sets of climate transition plan guidance available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, the company established <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/sustainability-net-zero-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robust goals</a> to significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its insurance and investment portfolios by 2050 or sooner. Further, it committed to 100% renewable energy for its operations by 2030, or sooner, and declared it would not invest in or provide insurance cover for any new Arctic energy exploration activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The insurance industry is pivotal to the transition to a low-carbon economy,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “We’re pleased AIG has not only set rigorous targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with its insurance products and investment practices, but now will be delivering a climate transition plan to provide investors insight into its strategies and next steps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with its 2050 goal, AIG also announced that <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/sustainability-net-zero-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will no longer invest or insure</a> the construction or operation of new coal-fired power plants, thermal coal mines or oil sands. The company pledged to phase out some existing insurance policies with coal-fired power plants, coal mines and oil sands by Jan. 1, 2030. </p>



<p><strong>AIG takes a big step toward transparency</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;AIG’s goals and plans come at a time when climate conditions are driving stronger storms, wildfires, hurricanes, and droughts, which is making <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wildfire-risk-in-california-drives-insurers-to-pull-policies-for-pricey-homes-11642593601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurance expensive</a> for homeowners in climate-vulnerable areas.&nbsp; Experts anticipate climate change will leave <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2023/12/2024-insights/corporate-trends/climate-change-and-its-undeniable-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurers overexposed to climate risk</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a big step for AIG, and we look forward to continuing to work with the company as it outlines plans for meeting its rigorous and necessary climate targets,” said Katie Carter, director of Faith-Based Investing and Corporate Engagement for the Presbyterian Church, (U.S.A.).&nbsp;</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Applied has taken significant steps to lessen its impact on the planet. By 2030, the company aims to reduce its operational emissions by 50% and a portion of emissions from use of its sophisticated manufacturing equipment. In addition, it plans to install the largest rooftop solar array in the state of Texas on its Austin-based logistics service center and to reach 100% renewable electricity globally by 2030.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Applied is tackling its climate impact on many fronts, and we’re really pleased that it’s so proactive,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “In the future, we hope  Applied is transparent about its plan to achieve its ambitious goals. In other words, tell investors how you will position your company and products for a low-carbon world.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I was really pleased that Applied could see that, while good, its Net-Zero by 2040 plan could be even more helpful to investors if it included elements of a climate transition plan, that is, more insight into its thinking about short- and medium-term actions in its own operations and with customers and suppliers,” commented Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Applied responded well to Green Century’s concerns, and I think our agreement cements its leadership role in the manufacturing space.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Green Century then filed a shareholder proposal asking Corning to address its climate risk by adopting emissions reduction targets.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Established in 1851 as Corning Glass, the company’s products are linked to American history. For example, Corning produced the very first electric light bulbs for Thomas Edison in the 1880s, and in 1915 sold its first line of glass products that could be used for baking and storage under the brand name, Pyrex. More recently, Corning has delivered millions of miles of fiber optic cables to support widespread broadband access. Corning also developed a durable glass, known as Gorilla Glass, for Apple’s first iPhones, a product that is currently used in more than 8 billion devices worldwide, including smart phones, tablets, and laptops.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2023, Green Century followed up with Corning and asked the company to develop and publish a climate transition plan.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In early 2023, the General Secretary of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, urged business leaders at the World Economic Forum, to “put forward credible and transparent transition plans on how to achieve net-zero – and submit those plans before the end of this year.&#8221;  More than 4,100 organizations have disclosed to CDP (a reporting platform formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) that they have prepared climate transition plans; however, CDP reports that only 45% were public, and only 12.6% covered what are considered key elements of a credible transition plan. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Now that more and more companies have committed to significantly cut their emissions, investors and stakeholders want assurance that goals and targets aren’t just greenwashing,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “We’re eager to see Corning develop a credible climate transition plan provides milestones, indicators for success, mechanisms for board and executive oversight, and enough details to instill investor confidence.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
