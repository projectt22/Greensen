					<description><![CDATA[Boston, August 12, 2024 – In response to a shareholder proposal from United Church Funds, represented by Green Century° and Presbyterian Church, (U.S.A.) as well as dialogue with other stakeholders, [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p></p>



<p><strong>Boston, August 12, 2024</strong> – In response to a shareholder proposal from United Church Funds, represented by Green Century° and Presbyterian Church, (U.S.A.) as well as dialogue with other stakeholders, the American International Group (AIG) <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will publish a roadmap</a> explaining how it will fulfill its climate goals and address climate risk. </p>



<p>While AIG is developing climate transition plans in response to regulatory requirements in international jurisdictions, the climate transition plan it intends to deliver to investors will cover its U.S. business as well. It committed to following the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/blog/emea-centre-for-regulatory-strategy/2023/transition-plan-taskforces-final-disclosure-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transition Plan Taskforce Disclosure Framework</a>, one of the most comprehensive and detailed sets of climate transition plan guidance available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, the company established <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/sustainability-net-zero-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">robust goals</a> to significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its insurance and investment portfolios by 2050 or sooner. Further, it committed to 100% renewable energy for its operations by 2030, or sooner, and declared it would not invest in or provide insurance cover for any new Arctic energy exploration activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The insurance industry is pivotal to the transition to a low-carbon economy,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “We’re pleased AIG has not only set rigorous targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with its insurance products and investment practices, but now will be delivering a climate transition plan to provide investors insight into its strategies and next steps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with its 2050 goal, AIG also announced that <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/sustainability-net-zero-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it will no longer invest or insure</a> the construction or operation of new coal-fired power plants, thermal coal mines or oil sands. The company pledged to phase out some existing insurance policies with coal-fired power plants, coal mines and oil sands by Jan. 1, 2030. </p>



<p><strong>AIG takes a big step toward transparency</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;AIG’s goals and plans come at a time when climate conditions are driving stronger storms, wildfires, hurricanes, and droughts, which is making <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wildfire-risk-in-california-drives-insurers-to-pull-policies-for-pricey-homes-11642593601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurance expensive</a> for homeowners in climate-vulnerable areas.&nbsp; Experts anticipate climate change will leave <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2023/12/2024-insights/corporate-trends/climate-change-and-its-undeniable-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurers overexposed to climate risk</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a big step for AIG, and we look forward to continuing to work with the company as it outlines plans for meeting its rigorous and necessary climate targets,” said Katie Carter, director of Faith-Based Investing and Corporate Engagement for the Presbyterian Church, (U.S.A.).&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our shareholder advocates have won successes in cutting plastics, carbon footprints and more from companies. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2024, Green Century held companies accountable and helped make change by convincing companies to share plastics use, disclose both direct and indirect carbon emissions and other environmental advances in the shareholder advocacy season. Here is a look at some of the <strong>Top 10 Highlights</strong> of our big year:</p>



<p><strong>1.&nbsp;<u><strong>Big</strong> Box Plastics:</u></strong> <strong>Costco*,</strong> the world’s third-largest retailer, agreed to make visible its plastic footprint for its signature Kirkland Brand products and unveiled a five-year action plan to reduce plastic packaging by year’s end.</p>

<p><strong><u>2.</u></strong><strong><u>Reducing Plastic Use: </u></strong>After our shareholder engagements, global entertainment giant <strong>Disney*</strong> and toymakers <strong>Hasbro* </strong>and <strong>Mattel*</strong>, hotels <strong>Marriott*</strong>, <strong>Hilton*</strong>, and <strong>Choice Hotels*</strong>, and other companies agreed to disclose their plastic footprints and/or set goals to cut plastic use.</p>

<p><strong>3. Protecting Nature:</strong> Green Century’s team filed a resolution at <strong>PepsiCo* </strong>urging the snack and beverage behemoth to address protecting nature and habitats. This was the first time shareholders of a publicly traded company voted on a proposal requesting a comprehensive biodiversity report.</p>

<p><strong><u>4. Safeguarding an Environmental Treasure</u></strong>: Green Century continued its multi-year effort to protect the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia from the threat of a proposed mine for titanium, a widely used pigment in paint, sunscreens and other products. The 438,000-acre refuge is a vital habitat for threatened and endangered species. Our shareholder resolutions at The <strong>Chemours Company*</strong>, <strong>Sherwin-Williams* </strong>and <strong>Home Depot* </strong>helped raise awareness and galvanize environmental leaders to protect this special place.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-medium wp-image-7335"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Cypress-tree-in-Okefenokee-swamp-by-John-Wollwerthshutterstock_1668165973-scaled-1-300x200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-7335" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Cypress-tree-in-Okefenokee-swamp-by-John-Wollwerthshutterstock_1668165973-scaled-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Cypress-tree-in-Okefenokee-swamp-by-John-Wollwerthshutterstock_1668165973-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Cypress-tree-in-Okefenokee-swamp-by-John-Wollwerthshutterstock_1668165973-scaled-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Cypress-tree-in-Okefenokee-swamp-by-John-Wollwerthshutterstock_1668165973-scaled-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Cypress-tree-in-Okefenokee-swamp-by-John-Wollwerthshutterstock_1668165973-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by <a href="http://www.wollwerthimagery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Wollwerth</a> on <a href="http://www.wollwerthimagery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alamy</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><u>5. Protecting Clean Air</u>: Lowe’s*</strong>, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, will share details on the planet-warming emissions from the products it sells in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century. This kind of disclosure is a key first step in cutting pollution from items such as lawncare equipment, which are often among the biggest polluters for retailers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-medium wp-image-9854"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9854" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-2048x1364.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@marcinjozwiak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcin Jozwiak</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/white-smoke-coming-from-building-T-eDxGcn-Ok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><u>6. Curbing Emissions:</u></strong> While <strong>IBM*</strong> has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce all of its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won a whopping 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-medium wp-image-21726"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="146" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/ales-krivec-x4Jc4HKEHKg-unsplash-300x146.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-21726" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/ales-krivec-x4Jc4HKEHKg-unsplash-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/ales-krivec-x4Jc4HKEHKg-unsplash-1024x499.jpg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/ales-krivec-x4Jc4HKEHKg-unsplash-768x374.jpg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/ales-krivec-x4Jc4HKEHKg-unsplash-1536x749.jpg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/ales-krivec-x4Jc4HKEHKg-unsplash-2048x998.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@aleskrivec" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ales Krivec</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photo-of-snow-capped-mountain-surrounded-by-sea-of-clouds-x4Jc4HKEHKg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><u>7. Right to Repair</u></strong>: In a big win for the environment, Green Century worked with <strong>Microsoft Corp.* </strong>to extend the lifespan of its computers. In response to a proposal from Green Century, Microsoft announced it would extend Windows 10 security updates for organizations of all sizes, including schools, hospitals, and individuals. This move could prevent up to 400 million computers from becoming electronic waste in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong><u>8.
