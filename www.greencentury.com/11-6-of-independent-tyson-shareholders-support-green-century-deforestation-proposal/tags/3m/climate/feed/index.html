										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you thought the weather was a little warm last year, it wasn’t your imagination. In fact, 2023 was the <a href="https://wmo.int/media/news/wmo-confirms-2023-smashes-global-temperature-record" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hottest year on record</a>. For decades, scientists have predicted weather extremes including heat waves, and they point to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as the culprit.</p>
<p>To head off catastrophic warming, the head of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has urged nations to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/un-chief-urges-faster-shift-net-zero-after-report-highlights-climate-threat-2023-03-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“slash emissions”</a> and business leaders to set <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/davos-2023-un-chief-urges-credible-net-zero-pledges-or-risk-greenwashing-2023-01-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets</a>.  “If we act now, we can still <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2023/03/20/press-release-ar6-synthesis-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secure a livable sustainable future</a> for all,” asserted another United Nations climate expert.</p>
<p>Green Century° presses companies to set goals to <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/annie-sanders-why-we-work-on-certain-issues-our-priorities-for-fy24/">drastically cut their emissions</a>. But we know that goals are not enough. Green Century holds companies accountable by asking them to develop and publish climate transition plans. If such a plan sounds like something only scientists would read, try this analogy.</p>
<h3>What is a Climate Transition Plan?</h3>
<figure id="attachment_19285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19285" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-19285 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CTP-graphic-300x251.png" alt="" width="300" height="251" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19285" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Photographer Name on Image Source</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Imagine your daughter (who represents a company in this example) announces that she’s going on a cross-country road trip to San Francisco with her friends. Naturally, you (the investor) are immediately flooded with questions: Which route will you take? Where will you stop along the way? How are you going to pay for this trip? What if you run into unforeseen problems like storms or a flat tire?  How often will you stay in touch?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For her to reach her destination, you want to know that she has mapped out a route, saved money for the trip, has overnight lodging and has plans to communicate with you on a regular basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the corporate world, that’s what a climate transition plan does. It fills in the gap between where a company starts its journey and how it plans to get to its destination.</p>
<p><strong>Intel’s* First Climate Transition Plan</strong></p>
<p>In a real-world example, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel Corp</a>., the famous computer chip maker, had set goals to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from its business operations to be net-zero by 2040. This means it committed to cut its emissions significantly by 2040 and has pledged to work with its suppliers to reduce their emissions by 30% by 2030.</p>
<p>Green Century noticed that Intel had not developed a climate transition plan and worried that the chip manufacturer’s goals might not be fully credible without one. We filed a shareholder resolution in 2022 with the company, and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-successfully-secures-commitments-with-five-semiconductor-companies-to-create-climate-transition-plans/">it agreed to publish a climate transition</a> within six months. As soon as it was released, Intel contacted Green Century to share its <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/2023-11/climate-transition-action-plan-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaugural plan.</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19282 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/andreas-gucklhorn-Ilpf2eUPpUE-unsplash-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Intel&#8217;s plans include requesting suppliers set 100% renewable electricity and develop project roadmaps to achieve their goals, implement energy conservation projects, build new green factories and facilities, and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases used to manufacture its computer chips. Their deadline is 2030.</p>
<p>Green Century is pleased with Intel’s first plan, which creates a solid foundation from which to build more detailed plans in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the urgency of limiting the impacts of climate change, Green Century will continue to work with our portfolio companies to make the dramatic emissions reductions needed to protect the planet and ourselves. The work will be hard, but preparing a solid climate transition plan provides investors assurance that companies intend to do the necessary hard things.</p>

<p><strong>Media Contacts: </strong>Andrea Ranger, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813; Mark Morgenstein, mmorgenstein@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</p>



<p><strong>Boston, August 11, 2022 – </strong>Green Century° has filed a shareholder proposal asking U-Haul’s parent company AMERCO to adopt science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement goal to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. The proposal goes to a vote at the company’s annual general meeting, which will be held in Phoenix at 9:00 a.m. PT on Aug. 18.</p>



<p>AMERCO owns and rents a sizable fleet of more than 176,000 light- and medium-duty vehicles. Despite the fact that the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gasses in the United States, the company has yet to do its part by setting greenhouse gas reduction targets or starting to transition its fleet to zero emission vehicles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger commented, “It’s remarkable that a company of AMERCO’s size and resources has yet to claim responsibility for the greenhouse gasses emitted by its rental trucks and vans. It should join the ranks of the more than 3,500 companies that have set or committed to set science-based targets inclusive of both their direct and indirect emissions.”</p>



<p>AMERCO peers continue to measure and eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Ryder and Public Storage publish their greenhouse gas emission metrics and reduction targets, and Ryder has set ambitious goals to reduce its Scope 1 emissions (i.e. direct emissions) by 10%, Scope 2 emissions (i.e. emissions from purchased energy such as electricity) by 30%, and Scope 3 (e.g. emissions from its leased trucks) by 15% by 2024. Additionally, Ryder has launched a pilot program for renting and leasing electric-powered vans.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>AMERCO’s Lack of Focus on Climate May Risk Alienating Millennial and Gen Z Customers</strong></h2>



<p>“Gen Z and millennials are demanding clean, green products and services,” stated Ranger. “AMERCO needs to make sure that its iconic U-Haul brand moving trucks, beloved by itinerant college students and 20-somethings making their way in the world, don’t get stigmatized as irresponsible sources of global warming emissions. AMERCO should take advantage of this opportunity.”</p>



<p>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich added, “We’re concerned that corporations are not doing enough to address the threat of climate change. In this instance, AMERCO’s well-regarded U-Haul brand may be vulnerable if it doesn’t make a speedy course correction and embrace a future of zero emission vehicles and buildings that run on 100% renewable energy. Without change, AMERCO customers, young or old, may just find another route to take for their moving and storage needs.”</p>

<p><strong>Media Contacts: </strong>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813; Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, <a href="mailto:mmorgenstein@greencentury.com">mmorgenstein@greencentury.com</a>, 678-427-1671</p>



<p><strong>Boston, August 4, 2022 </strong>–&nbsp; On Thursday, Green Century° and Nathan Cummings Foundation received strong support for their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459022024064/tsla-def14a_20220804.htm#PROPOSAL_TEN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shareholder proposal</a> requesting that Tesla establish lobbying policies aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. However, the proposal failed to capture a majority of the votes cast.</p>



<p>The proposal asked Tesla to conduct an evaluation describing whether its lobbying and policy influence activities (direct and through trade associations and social welfare and nonprofit organizations) align with the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tesla has dominated U.S. electric vehicle sales and become one of the largest solar technology providers in the country. However, despite its value to environmentally-responsible investors, it has attracted criticism due its mixed performance on corporate governance issues. In December, Tesla’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-comes-out-against-federal-electric-vehicle-spending-11638892791?mod=e2fb&amp;tesla=y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founder and CEO</a> Elon Musk spoke out against federal support for electric vehicle charging stations even though charging infrastructure is critical to growing the electric vehicle market.</p>



<p><strong>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich issued this statement about the vote:</strong></p>



<p>“Although we didn’t attain a majority, we’re still pleased with the outcome of this vote. We believe it shows that&nbsp; investors are seeking better insight into the nuts and bolts of how Tesla is making policy and lobbying decisions. While it makes sense that a company whose core business is designing, manufacturing and selling electric vehicles, solar panels and battery storage would support the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming, it’s not clear whether Tesla has articulated this goal in its direct or indirect lobbying. We think it’s time Tesla did.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger added:</strong></p>



<p>“We’re proud to be Tesla investors and support a company that plays a leading role in a much-needed transition to a future powered by clean energy. Much to its credit, Tesla has grown rapidly in the last several years. However, we seem to be seeing growing pains. Tesla does not appear to be attending to business fundamentals, such as disclosing the policies that guide how it uses its influence. Given the sometimes unpredictable nature of Tesla&#8217;s high-profile CEO, we find it even more essential that the board and management establish policy guardrails. We’ll continue to keep the pressure on Tesla until we see measurable change on this issue.”</p>
