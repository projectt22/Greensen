<p><strong>Boston, June 26, 2025</strong> – Conagra Brands*, the parent company of Orville Redenbacher’s, Duncan Hines, Slim Jim and other well-known food brands will assess whether it should replicate the nature and biodiversity protections it employs in forests in non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco in Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.</p>



<p>“Food companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It’s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.”</p>



<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat</strong></p>



<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina. The Cerrado alone, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% of all species</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on Earth, has lost </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million acres of natural savanna</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in recent decades</a>. This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.</p>



<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection</strong></p>



<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company’s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;It’s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, April 22, 2024</strong> – Archer-Daniels-Midland Company* (ADM), one of the largest agricultural companies in the world, has released a <a href="https://www.adm.com/en-us/sustainability/no-conversion-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> that informed a <a href="https://www.adm.com/globalassets/sustainability/goals--programs/protect-biodiversity-forests-communities/11-2023-protect-biodiversity-forests-communities-enlgish.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new policy</a> to enhance protections for South American ecosystems key to global biodiversity and the fight against climate change. ADM’s new policy will eliminate primary native vegetation conversion, or the repurposing of wild land for crops such as soy and corn, from its global supply chains by 2025 for direct suppliers and by 2027 for indirect suppliers.</p>
<p>“Critical ecosystems like the Cerrado, Gran Chaco and Pantanal may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they’re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds°. “We congratulate ADM on enhancing protections for these special places.”</p>
<p><strong>Shareholder Proposal Prompted Study, Protections </strong></p>
<p>In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Robeco and BNP Paribas Asset Management, ADM had agreed in spring 2023 to conduct a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/adm-moves-to-strengthen-no-deforestation-policy/">feasibility study</a> to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its South American soy and corn supply chains and issue a correlated commitment. The feasibility study completed in November 2023 and published in April 2024 informed ADM’s new “no-conversion” commitment, which covers supply chains in the Brazilian Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, as well as the Paraguayan and Argentinian Chaco.</p>
<p>“We believe ADM has made significant progress in ensuring business continuity in an increasingly fragile ecosystem by having a clear outlook on key areas needing protection across its supply chain,” said Peter van der Werf, Head of Engagement at Robeco. “Importantly, the assessment allows ADM to prioritize already degraded land fit for further agricultural expansion, allowing it to steer investments and help farmers to move forward in a sustainable manner.”</p>
<p>Native vegetation conversion <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrades ecosystems such as the Cerrado</a> savanna in Brazil that are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Soy production is a <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of native vegetation conversion</a> in South American habitats and contributes to a broader decline of South American wilderness.</p>
