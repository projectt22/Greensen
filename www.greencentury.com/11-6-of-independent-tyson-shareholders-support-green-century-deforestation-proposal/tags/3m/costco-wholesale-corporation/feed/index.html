<p><span data-contrast="auto">(</span><b><span data-contrast="auto">BOSTON, 10/10/23</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">) – </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/"><span data-contrast="none">Green Century</span></a><i><span data-contrast="none">° </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">reached a deal with Costco Wholesale* which committed to increased plastic footprint disclosures and a new 5-year plastic action plan. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="none">We commend Costco for providing the information that investors need and for taking steps to reduce their use of plastic, especially new plastics,” </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">said </span></b><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><b><span data-contrast="none">Leslie Samuelrich</span></b></a><b><span data-contrast="auto">, President of Green Century Funds</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. “We look forward to working with the company to reduce its contribution to the plastic crisis by setting reduction targets that will meaningfully protect our oceans and wildlife.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In response to the growing global crisis of single-use plastic waste, Green Century Capital Management approached Costco to explore how the retailing giant could expand the scope and scale of its plastic reduction efforts. The outcome of these discussions led to a new commitment by Costco to transparency and action.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The disclosures, which are expected to be unveiled in July of 2024, include the total plastic footprint of Costco’s in-house brand, Kirkland Signature. The company will also disclose for the first time the total percentage of recycled content in its plastic packaging, an important indicator of environmental plastics commitments. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In December of 2024, Costco will release its 5-year plastic action plan that will outline the steps the company will take to reduce total plastic in its Kirkland Signature packaging, as well as report on progress made each year of the plan.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">Costco Takes Action on Plastics, Yet More Work Is Needed</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Despite Costco’s recent commitments, more work is needed to address the company’s exposure to single use plastics. In May of 2023, 185 asset managers with $10 trillion under management, including Green Century, signed a <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EMBARGO_VBDO_Investor-statement-on-plastics_def.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> calling for companies to immediately reduce single-use plastic packaging, upscale reusables systems, phase out hazardous chemicals</span><span data-contrast="auto">,</span><span data-contrast="auto"> and advocate for responsible plastics legislation. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Companies need to take single-use plastic risk seriously,” </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">said </span></b><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><b><span data-contrast="none">Douglass Guernsey</span></b></a><b><span data-contrast="auto">, shareholder advocate at Green Century</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. “Single-use plastics cost society an estimated $350 billion per year in emissions, ocean pollution and collection. Increasing regulation and litigation risk means these costs will be returned to companies that produce such excessive, unrecyclable plastic. Frankly, it’s past time to act.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
