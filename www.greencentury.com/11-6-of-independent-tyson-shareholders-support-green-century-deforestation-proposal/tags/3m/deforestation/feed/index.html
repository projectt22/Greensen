<p><strong>Boston, June 26, 2025</strong> – Conagra Brands*, the parent company of Orville Redenbacher’s, Duncan Hines, Slim Jim and other well-known food brands will assess whether it should replicate the nature and biodiversity protections it employs in forests in non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco in Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.</p>



<p>“Food companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It’s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.”</p>



<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat</strong></p>



<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina. The Cerrado alone, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% of all species</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on Earth, has lost </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million acres of natural savanna</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in recent decades</a>. This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.</p>



<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection</strong></p>



<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company’s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;It’s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2025</strong> – J.M. Smucker*, parent company of Folgers, Café Bustelo and Dunkin’ at Home coffee products, has agreed to review its forest protection policies with an ambition of eventually sourcing all of its ingredients without any collateral deforestation. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century Capital Management.</p>



<p>“As investors, we encourage companies to reduce their material risks and improve their environmental impact,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Smuckers’ will follow up its research swiftly with a commitment to source coffee and other ingredients from verified deforestation-free sources.”</p>



<p>J.M. Smucker is the largest seller of at-home coffee in the <a href="https://www.jmsmucker.com/brands-you-love/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a>. It also produces its namesake jellies, Hostess Twinkies, Milk Bone dog biscuits, and a wide range of other popular <a href="https://www.jmsmucker.com/brands-you-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack and pet foods</a>. Coffee and other agricultural products are among the largest drivers of global <a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2022/06/deforestation-in-coffee-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Assessment followed by commitment</strong></p>



<p>As part of its agreement with Green Century, in 2025, J.M. Smucker will assess the steps necessary to ensure the company uses deforestation-free supplies of coffee, palm, soy and cocoa, as well as wood pulp used in packaging. The company plans to follow the assessment with a transition to deforestation-free supplies in 2026, as commercially feasible. Any policy adopted will include ongoing third-party assurance of forest protection practices as well as a grievance system for reporting violations.</p>



<p><strong>Forest protection is climate protection</strong></p>



<p>Deforestation and destruction of other natural habitats is responsible for <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Forests can also play an important role in removing carbon from the atmosphere, <a href="https://www.woodwellclimate.org/global-forest-carbon-storage-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but only if they are allowed to grow and thrive</a>. The <a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatest driver of deforestation globally is agriculture</a>, making it critical for food companies to commit to deforestation-free ingredients. </p>



<p>&#8220;J.M. Smucker has woken up and smelled the coffee,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;American consumers love their morning joe and they also want to protect the environment. These steps will help J.M. Smucker do both things, and provide sustainable coffee, snacks, and pet products.”</p>

<p></p>



<p>I recently represented Green Century Funds at the Archdiocese of Boston’s 16th Annual Social Justice Convocation. The event was inspired by Pope Francis’ call to &#8220;every living person on the planet” to recognize the immediate threat of climate change and to care for the environment.</p>



<p><br>This event brought together priests, nuns, parishioners, students, and even Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, all seemingly united in their commitment to making a positive environmental impact in their communities. The people I spoke with were inspired by the belief that their investments could drive meaningful environmental change, with many attending this gathering to green their parishes. Many expressed frustrations with current practices and voiced concerns about the future of our environment.</p>



<p><br>I decided to work at Green Century because I believe the organization offers an impactful way to address environmental challenges. Green Century rethinks traditional investment systems that too often harm the environment. Instead, Green Century offers people an opportunity to invest in a way that follows their environmental values.</p>



<p><br>This convocation was a great place for Green Century, not only because I met individuals who have already invested in the funds, but also because the event reflected a shared commitment to change the status quo. The event showcased a 2,000-year-old institution—the Catholic Church—now dedicated to integrating sustainability into its long-standing tradition. To me, this is a powerful symbol of progress and a beacon of hope. It serves as a reminder that, despite our diverse backgrounds and perspectives, our planet is a shared home, and the responsibility to care for it belongs to all of us.</p>



<p><br>A major part of sustainability is recognizing how we as individuals can act to protect the environment. Green Century is for all types of investors, small and large, and our funds help people invest with their values. I spoke with several people who were interested in environmentally responsible investing as an option.</p>



<p><br>I left the event energized by the spirit of community and the shared sentiment of making choices and acting in ways to help preserve our planet and conserve our natural resources for future generations.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, February 20, 2025</strong> – Bloomin&#8217; Brands, parent company of several of the largest U.S. restaurant chains, has agreed to strengthen its commitment to protect forests when sourcing ingredients for its 1,480 restaurants around the world. The move came after Green Century Capital Management filed a shareholder proposal asking the company to assess its impact on biodiversity and nature loss.</p>



<p>“We congratulate Bloomin&#8217; Brands on strengthening its forest protection policies,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “When you go out for dinner, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry that people are cutting down forests in the Amazon so you can eat your meal.”</p>



<p>Bloomin&#8217; Brands owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and several other casual dining chains. Through direct ownership and franchises it is responsible for <a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/d653a2f0-ac33-4137-80f8-93636fba2f03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,150 restaurants in the United States</a> and smaller numbers in other countries.</p>



<p><strong>Beef and Palm Oil Drive Tropical Deforestation</strong></p>



<p>Beef and palm oil production are among the largest reasons for the loss of rainforests worldwide. In exchange for Green Century withdrawing its shareholder proposal, Bloomin&#8217; Brands agreed to strengthen its policies to protect forests when sourcing these ingredients. For the first time, the company will disclose the percentage of beef sourced from Brazil. In addition, Bloomin’ says it will ensure that 60% of that Brazilian beef will come from verified deforestation-free sources. The company says it aims to increase this commitment to 100% in the future.</p>



<p>Bloomin’ will also improve the traceability of its palm oil products and agreed to include biodiversity impacts in the double-materiality assessment it is undertaking in 2025.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bloomin&#8217; Brands has a significant presence in Brazil, raising the possibility that beef sold in the company’s restaurants contributes to forest loss in the Amazon,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;We appreciate the company&#8217;s willingness to begin tracking and disclosing its beef sourcing specific to Brazil. We hope this will pave the way for a commitment to 100% deforestation-free beef in the near future.&#8221; Green Century has been pressing Bloomin’ Brands to improve its forest protection policies for several years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/notable-43-of-bloomin-brands-shareholders-support-green-century-proposal-to-address-climate-change-and-deforestation/">43% of the company’s shareholders</a> voted in favor of a shareholder proposal by Green Century to address climate change and improve forest protection.</p>

<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>

<p><strong>BOSTON, October 16, 2024</strong> – In response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century<em>°</em>, Costco Wholesale Corporation* committed to publishing a comprehensive deforestation assessment and action plan for its Kirkland Signature brand. In exchange, Green Century and co-filer Boston Common Asset Management agreed to withdraw the proposal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nature-related risks have emerged as a high priority issue for investors in the last year and we applaud Costco for strengthening its efforts to protect vital habitats around the world, <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Millions of Costco members will be gratified to know that their favorite Kirkland Signature items may be moving towards protecting rather than harming tropical forests, home to species from jaguars to giant otters.”</p>



<p>Costco says it plans to release its deforestation assessment and action plan by the end of 2025. The disclosure will lay out Costco’s roadmap to protect forests and other natural landscapes from deforestation when sourcing its beef, palm oil, soy and wood products. Those industries combined drive nearly three-quarters of tropical <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/drivers-of-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Costco to consider first-ever ‘no-deforestation’ targets</strong></p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/dining/costco.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly one-third</a> of U.S. consumers shop at Costco, making it the third-largest retailer in the world behind Amazon and Walmart. Kirkland-brand items generated <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-built-56-billion-kirkland-120000770.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADPkNhgRSwQj1r5dDPyAw8P3vBeCsB_YPGKih1keNcrKIBb5hbzW-oByMFBSsRutYAs9SZw6_c7_yFljzYHttINMKR7CpPyozBe04lFUYxpkpSBH8c4ASdbsEhkhHu0vNyimz1CJjpoq2VFIzt7BwZFeuT68TetxpF2VK5i8TF6f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$56 billion</a> in revenue for Costco last fiscal year – more than Nike, Coca-Cola, and United Airlines. The brand’s massive footprint means any incremental commitment to protect the planet has an outsized effect.</p>



<p>Many countries <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/policies-tackling-deforestation-pose-investor-risk-report-says-2024-03-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented new policies</a> last year to preserve forests, promote biodiversity and help the climate. While Costco did not commit to fully eliminating deforestation from its Kirkland Signature brand supply chains, the wholesaler stated that it will consider adopting time-bound deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) commitments for beef, soy, palm oil and/or wood products in its forthcoming deforestation action plan.</p>



<p>“Costco knows it shouldn’t destroy tropical forests to stock its shelves,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, Director of Shareholder Advocacy at Green Century</strong>. “We appreciate this step and encourage the company to further protect global forests by setting time-bound no-deforestation targets across its supply chain.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our shareholder advocates have won successes in cutting plastics, carbon footprints and more from companies. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2024, Green Century held companies accountable and helped make change by convincing companies to share plastics use, disclose both direct and indirect carbon emissions and other environmental advances in the shareholder advocacy season. Here is a look at some of the <strong>Top 10 Highlights</strong> of our big year:</p>



<p><strong>1.&nbsp;<u><strong>Big</strong> Box Plastics:</u></strong> <strong>Costco*,</strong> the world’s third-largest retailer, agreed to make visible its plastic footprint for its signature Kirkland Brand products and unveiled a five-year action plan to reduce plastic packaging by year’s end.</p>

<p><strong><u>2.</u></strong><strong><u>Reducing Plastic Use: </u></strong>After our shareholder engagements, global entertainment giant <strong>Disney*</strong> and toymakers <strong>Hasbro* </strong>and <strong>Mattel*</strong>, hotels <strong>Marriott*</strong>, <strong>Hilton*</strong>, and <strong>Choice Hotels*</strong>, and other companies agreed to disclose their plastic footprints and/or set goals to cut plastic use.</p>

<p><strong>3. Protecting Nature:</strong> Green Century’s team filed a resolution at <strong>PepsiCo* </strong>urging the snack and beverage behemoth to address protecting nature and habitats. This was the first time shareholders of a publicly traded company voted on a proposal requesting a comprehensive biodiversity report.</p>

<p><strong><u>4. Safeguarding an Environmental Treasure</u></strong>: Green Century continued its multi-year effort to protect the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia from the threat of a proposed mine for titanium, a widely used pigment in paint, sunscreens and other products. The 438,000-acre refuge is a vital habitat for threatened and endangered species. Our shareholder resolutions at The <strong>Chemours Company*</strong>, <strong>Sherwin-Williams* </strong>and <strong>Home Depot* </strong>helped raise awareness and galvanize environmental leaders to protect this special place.</p>

<p><strong><u>5. Protecting Clean Air</u>: Lowe’s*</strong>, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, will share details on the planet-warming emissions from the products it sells in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century. This kind of disclosure is a key first step in cutting pollution from items such as lawncare equipment, which are often among the biggest polluters for retailers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone size-medium wp-image-9854"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9854" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/marcin-jozwiak-T-eDxGcn-Ok-unsplash-2048x1364.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@marcinjozwiak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcin Jozwiak</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/white-smoke-coming-from-building-T-eDxGcn-Ok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><u>6. Curbing Emissions:</u></strong> While <strong>IBM*</strong> has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce all of its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won a whopping 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</p>

<p><strong><u>7. Right to Repair</u></strong>: In a big win for the environment, Green Century worked with <strong>Microsoft Corp.* </strong>to extend the lifespan of its computers. In response to a proposal from Green Century, Microsoft announced it would extend Windows 10 security updates for organizations of all sizes, including schools, hospitals, and individuals. This move could prevent up to 400 million computers from becoming electronic waste in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong><u>8. Preserving Tropical Forests</u>: </strong>Global agribusiness giant <strong>Bunge* </strong>sources soy from South American tropical ecosystems such as the biodiverse Amazon and neighboring Cerrado savanna where jaguars, giant otters and other rare animals live. These are the last places we should be clearing forests for food. After negotiations with Green Century, Bunge agreed to strengthen protections for these special places.</p>

<p><strong><u>9. Climate Transition Plans</u></strong>: One of the world&#8217;s largest fossil fuel insurers in the world, had set an ambitious target to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its business. After engagement with Green Century, this company agreed to publish a road map, or climate transition plan, explaining how it will achieve its emissions reduction goals.</p>

<p><strong><u>10. Insurance Wins: </u></strong>Green Century pushed <strong>Chubb*</strong> to phase out insurance for new fossil fuel supplies. The company, which is the largest publicly traded commercial property and casualty insurer in the world and a major insurer of oil drilling off the coast of Brazil, announced in 2023 it would no longer write policies for new extraction or pipelines in conservation areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, which received a 28% vote, asked Chubb to measure and disclose emissions associated with its underwriting, insurance, and investment-related activities. Secondly, Green Century filed a resolution, which received 38 percent of the vote, met with insurer <strong>Markel*</strong> to measure and disclose emissions associated with its underwriting, insurance, and investment-related activities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, June 7, 2024 – Recently, 13.7% of votes were cast in favor of a Green Century° proposal asking General Motors* to improve the sustainability of its aluminum, steel, rubber, and leather supply chains.]]></description>

<p style="padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0"><strong>Boston, June 7, 2024 –</strong> Recently, 13.7% of votes were cast in favor of a Green Century° proposal asking General Motors* to improve the sustainability of its aluminum, steel, rubber, and leather supply chains. Specifically, the proposal requested that General Motors issue an annual report providing additional disclosure on these sustainability risks within its supply chain, as well as on risk mitigation efforts.</p>



<p>“Ultimately, we don’t think GM wants to be associated with exacerbating global warming or destroying the rainforest,” said Leslie Samuelrich, Green Century Funds President. “If the company truly wants to clean up its supply chain and ensure a timely transition to a sustainable future, it should invest now in clean, green, deforestation-free supply chains.”</p>



<p>The aluminum and steel sectors emit billions of tons of climate pollution annually and will require rapid decarbonization to avoid catastrophic global warming. Leather and rubber, both commonly used in vehicle manufacturing, are linked to tropical deforestation from Brazil to Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>General Motors’ <a href="https://www.gm.com/commitments/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goals</a> to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 and sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035 may depend in part on how it responds to concerns raised by Green Century’s proposal.</p>



<p>So far, General Motors has not established clear targets for procuring green steel or aluminum, nor has it joined industry associations such as <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteelTM</a> that are working to increase customer demand for green steel. The company may also be sourcing leather and rubber from regions associated with deforestation and currently lacks the disclosure, targets and metrics to indicate progress toward deforestation-free supply chains.</p>



<p>“As one of the largest auto companies in the world, GM has a leadership role to play in addressing climate and deforestation risk,” said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “Many European auto companies, such as BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Volvo, are already making commitments to source low-carbon metals and protect forests. GM has an opportunity to both catch up to these peers and lead the way for American manufacturers.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2024</strong>  – Ford Motor Company shareholders delivered 6.6<strong>%</strong> of votes cast in support of Green Century’s<em>°</em> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465924040871/tm2318496-d4_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolution</a> asking the company to eliminate materials linked to deforestation in its cars and trucks. The proposal also asked Ford to buy more sustainable steel and aluminum, and pushed for the company to purchase steel and aluminum plants that run off of clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Ford family has significant control over Ford business decisions because it owns a special class of stock that ensures it has  <a href="https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/the-ford-family-a-permanent-mark-in-business-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of the voting power</a>. Votes against the Green Century proposal by Ford family members could have negatively impacted the vote result.</p>
<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raising cattle</a>, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting rubber</a>, and <a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/1827220/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining minerals</a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage in vulnerable areas such as Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. Deforestation is now one of the leading drivers of <a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> and <a href="https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/how-does-deforestation-impact-wildlife-and-biodiversity-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biodiversity loss.</a></p>
<p>Heavy emitting industries such as steel and aluminum also contribute to climate change. Currently, not a single ton of sustainable steel and aluminum is manufactured in the United States. Green Century’s proposal asks Ford to join organizations like <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a> and the <a href="https://aluminium-stewardship.org/drive-change/sustainability-priorities/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aluminum Stewardship Initiative</a>, which  develop sustainability certifications for aluminum and steel manufacturers and push them to replace fossil fuels with renewables.</p>
<p>“While we had wished for a higher vote, we’re pleased with the support we received,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Enhancing supply chain sustainably at Ford is a new initiative for us, and we plan to keep pressure on the company to address its material environmental risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Supply Chains Are Key</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, Ford set a target to purchase sustainable steel and aluminum for <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/11/09/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of its total steel and aluminum purchases by 2030</a>. The company also planned to <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/04/ford-updates-timing-for-next-gen-evs--readies-manufacturing-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add EVs to its fleet</a>, which are manufactured with more aluminum than gas-powered cars to offset the extra battery weight. The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative works to ensure that aluminum producers are cutting emissions significantly by 2025. Similarly, ResponsibleSteel has a mission to “&#8230;be a driving force in the socially and environmentally responsible production of net-zero steel, globally.” Ford may benefit by joining both organizations, using its influence as a major consumer of steel and aluminum to press for greener production.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone wants to buy a Ford Explorer or F-150 and learn that the leather, rubber, and minerals in their vehicles contributed to deforestation,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Sustainability needs to be woven into every aspect of Ford’s supply chain, because Green Century believe it’s good for Ford’s investors, customers, and the company itself.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 7, 2024</strong> – Shareholders prepare to vote on a Green Century <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465924040871/tm2318496-d4_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a> at Ford’s May 9 annual general meeting. The proposal asks Ford to disclose deforestation risk associated with the leather, rubber, and minerals it buys, and encourages the company to support efforts to expand supplies of green steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for  car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raising cattle</a>, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting rubber</a>, and <a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/1827220/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining minerals</a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage. However, the company is silent on how these materials could lead to long-term environmental damage, especially in vulnerable areas like Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Ford has committed to buying <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/11/09/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green primary steel and aluminum for 10%</a> of its total purchase by 2030. Yet not one ton of green steel or aluminum is manufactured currently in the United States. The proposal asks Ford how it will attain its 2030 goal and to join NGO-led organizations like ResponsibleSteel and the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative (ASI), which support sustainable production of these metals.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled that Ford is advancing quickly to manufacture climate friendly vehicles – like EVs,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “But the company faces material risk in its supply chain from the products it uses. Companies have to be relentless in investigating and changing their total impact on the environment.”</p>
<p><strong>Competitors Exceed Ford On Green Steel and Aluminum </strong></p>
<p>Volvo and Mercedes-Benz participate in the steel plant sustainability standard, <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a>, and Volvo has joined <a href="https://www.theclimategroup.org/about-steelzero-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelZero</a>, where members commit purchasing 100% green steel by 2050. Ford would be the first North American auto manufacturer to participate in these initiatives and could accelerate the wider availability of green metals.</p>
<p>“Ford’s Road to Better slogan describes its commitment to building a more sustainable  transportation future,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Instead of  fighting our proposal at the ballot box, we want Ford to remain on the Road to Better. We believe Ford should implement our proposal to protect nature and biodiversity and ensure it supports  development of steel and aluminum manufacturing that is powered by renewable energy.”</p>
