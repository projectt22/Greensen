<p><strong>Boston, March 24, 2022 – </strong>Green Century<em>°</em> has withdrawn a shareholder proposal with Dell Technologies after the company published a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/corporate/social-impact/advancing-sustainability/sustainable-products-and-services/circular-design.htm#scroll=off&amp;pdf-overlay=//www.dell.com/content/dam/documents-and-videos/dv1/en/solutions/business-solutions/briefs-summaries/design-for-environment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">position statement</a> that outlines its approach to product repair and circular design. In an accompanying <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/repair-reuse-recycle-the-circular-economy-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, the company highlights its definition of repairability and notes its longstanding support of its “customers’ choice to repair their own device.”</p>



<p>While Dell has long provided customers and independent repair shops with access to such repair resources as manuals and replacement parts, the company had never directly articulated its support for product repair choices. Given the growing momentum of the Right to Repair movement and increasing attention from regulators and legislators on the issue of manufacturers restricting repair to their own authorized servicers, investors wanted assurance that Dell is prepared to continue its industry-leading efforts to make product repair accessible.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to see Dell take a more explicit position on its efforts to enable product repair,” said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “We believe that remaining actively engaged in the Right to Repair conversation is critical for technology companies, from both a reputational and a regulatory perspective.”</p>



<p>In the last year, Right to Repair legislation has been introduced in 27 states and in the U.S. Congress. In July, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing the Federal Trade Commission to develop rules on “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair.”</p>



<p>Although the company leads industry peers like Apple* and Alphabet’s* Google on repair accessibility, investors remain concerned about Dell’s affiliation with industry trade groups such as TechNet and the Consumer Technology Association, which routinely lobby against Right to Repair reforms.</p>



<p>“Even industry leaders have room for improvement,” Tarizzo added. “We urge Dell to distance itself from trade groups whose lobbying activities run counter to its position on product repair.”</p>
