<div></div>
<div><b>Understand the problem</b></div>
<div>Plastic pollution is <u><a id="OWAedc00c13-0c08-8c14-e200-9f63f44db140" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-loopstyle="linkonly">growing explosively,</a></u> and recycling has failed to make a dent in ocean plastic pollution.</div>

<div></div>
<div><b>Spotlight on disclosure</b></div>
<div>Have you ever tried to cut something in the dark? It is clearly not the best idea, and at worst it can be dangerous. The same is true for cutting plastic use. Without clear information on how much and what kind of plastic companies are producing, we are all in the dark.</div>

<div><b>Get to Work</b></div>

					<p><strong>(Boston) </strong>Microsoft Corporation* <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be offering extended security updates (ESU) for Microsoft Education customers at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century°</a>, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/microsoft-extends-security-support-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">pushed</a> Microsoft to announce affordable ESU for Windows 10 computers. This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest jump in junked computers ever</a>.</p>
<p>“This allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong>, President of <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century Funds</a>. “It is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.”</p>
<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/10/windows_11_adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">330-400 million devices</a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000 petition signatures</a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.</p>
<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.</p>
<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>
<p>“Getting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate. “We encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.”</p>

					<p><b>(BOSTON) </b>Green Century° and Hilton Worldwide Holdings* reached a multi-year agreement for the major hotel chain to release an assessment of its single-use plastic by 2025 and set a plastic reduction goal by 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after competitors <a id="OWA8d5a00d0-04f6-7e87-8aae-8cc5e507a461" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/marriott-international-to-measure-cut-plastic-waste/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Marriott</a> and <a id="OWA7c7ba5ad-28f6-0034-d79a-25a6200cdd3c" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/choice-hotels-takes-first-step-in-tackling-plastic-pollution/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Choice Hotels</a> also agreed to measure and reduce single-use plastic, following agreements with Green Century.</p>
<p>“Neither Hilton nor its investors want to be stuck holding the bill for the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastic,” said <a id="OWA3a8141b8-fcc4-00d3-cbdf-c68eb0dca6d2" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds. “We applaud Hilton for committing to reduce its contribution to the plastic pollution crisis.”</p>
<h3><b>Plastic Pollution Crisis Continues to Grow</b></h3>
<p>Plastic pollution has been doubling every <a id="LPlnk561662" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six years</a>. Plastics don’t degrade, but break into small pieces called microplastics, which impact oceans, soil, the atmosphere, and human health.</p>
<p>“Consumers learn more everyday about the serious issues with plastic,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Companies need a strategy for the future beyond single-use plastic.”</p>
<p>Hilton, like its competitors, provides single-use plastic in its rooms, guest common spaces, and food service locations.</p>
<p>While the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastic have long alarmed scientists, the scale of crisis is just starting to be better understood by consumers.</p>
<p>According to a recent study, <a id="LPlnk643534" title="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seventy-five percent of Americans</a> want to see the private-sector offer plastic free options, and 72% agree that companies should stop producing and using so much single-use plastic.</p>

<p><strong>(March 13, Boston, MA) </strong>Marriott International, Inc*, the world’s largest hospitality company, will set a single-use plastic reduction goal by the end of 2025 and disclose a baseline footprint of single-use plastics starting in 2026, thanks to an agreement with Green Century°.</p>
<p>“We welcome Marriott’s commitment to transparency and to cutting its plastic use,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of the Green Century Funds. “Customers, investors, and business leaders value sustainability, so Marriott is taking the right approach to prepare for the future.”</p>
<p>Regulatory and economic pressures have pushed companies to disclose and reduce the use of non-essential single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Marriott has taken steps toward reducing single-use plastic in its operations, including transitioning away from tiny, single-use toiletry bottles to more-sustainable, larger bottles for bath amenities. The bigger bottles are more recyclable and help reduce plastic waste.</p>
<p>“Given Marriott’s scale, with more than 1.5 million hotel rooms worldwide, small changes make massive impacts,” said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “We are pleased that the company is working to create a more sustainable business and planet.”</p>
<p><strong>Plastic Pollution Continues its Explosive Growth</strong></p>
<p>Plastic pollution entering the oceans has been doubling every six years, killing 1 million marine creatures annually. More than 91% of plastics are not recycled.</p>
<p>Experts agree that reducing non-essential single-use plastic is necessary to address the growing plastic pollution crisis.</p>
<p>While some plastic doesn’t have viable alternatives, many single-use applications do.</p>
<p>“Companies first need to understand the scale of the problem and disclose the risks associated with it,” said Guernsey. “Only with reliable information can investors make cogent decisions to reduce the tidal wave of plastic pollution.”</p>

					<h4>Investors concerned over growing evidence of plastic toxicity</h4>
<p>(Boston, MA) Responding to investors’ scrutiny, Keurig Dr Pepper* has expanded its Chemical Management Policy to include forever chemicals PFAS, heavy metals and a family of plastic additives called bisphenols. The move comes after <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/en/2023/05/investors-with-us10-trillion-aum-call-on-corporates-to-drastically-ramp-up-action-on-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">185 investors</a> coordinated by the <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development</a> sent a letter to the company highlighting toxic additives in plastic packaging.</p>
<p>“Plastic packaging can be toxic at every stage of its lifecycle,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate at Green Century° who helped lead the investor engagement. “Thousands of potentially harmful plastic additives have been identified in food packaging. We expect companies to commit to identifying and eliminating the use of hazardous substances and to publicly report on their progress.”</p>
<p>Companies are currently not required to disclose plastic additives to consumers or investors. Of the over <a href="https://ikhapp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SCEPT_Policy_Brief_chemicals_polymers_of_concern_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13,000 chemicals added to plastics</a>, nearly 70% are known to be hazardous or have not been assessed for safety.</p>
<p>A growing body of evidence links plastic and its additives to <a href="https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/files/48995/Pete%20Myers%20testimony.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breast cancer, autism, infertility</a>, and other issues through endocrine disruption, which alter critical hormone functions.</p>
<p>Dr. Pete Myers, of the Environmental Health Sciences, speaking at a recent U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=D8583DB7-BFEE-480C-BBE3-AC1DCE04711B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing</a> emphasized the risks of endocrine disruption from plastic, stating that no plastic has been thoroughly tested using the tools of modern medical science.</p>
<p><strong>Plastic additives impact plastic recyclability, harm ecosystems, and damage human health.</strong></p>
<p>“We appreciate companies expanding chemical management policies, but it is really a bandage on a broken system,” said Guernsey. “What we need is an absolute reduction of single-use plastic, replaced with tested solutions like reusable bottles and plastic-free packaging.”</p>

					<h3>SEC blocks Green Century<em>°</em> shareholder proposal on Right to Repair at Deere &amp; Company*</h3>
<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, </strong><a href="mailto:dguernsey@greencentury.com"><strong>dguernsey@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, </strong><a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com"><strong>ppodger@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p>(<strong>Boston, MA</strong>) Shareholders will not get to vote on Deere &amp; Company’s opposition to Right to Repair at the company’s Annual General Meeting this year after the SEC granted Deere’s no action request.</p>
<p>This is the second time shareholders of the tractor company have been denied a vote on a Green Century proposal because of an SEC no-action request.</p>
<p>“It is disappointing that Deere doesn’t want to allow shareholders to vote on this issue,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “Allowing farmers the right to repair their own equipment is common sense, and Deere’s opposition presents reputational risks to the brand. In the end, this may hurt investors.”</p>
<p>Green Century submitted a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/deere-co-faces-shareholder-scrutiny-on-right-to-repair-stand/">shareholder proposal</a> asking Deere to issue a public report on the benefits and drawbacks of opposing Right to Repair regulation and the financial and reputational risk associated with opposition in Q4 of 2023.</p>
<p>Deere’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcefdeere122923-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposition</a> was based on the argument that Green Century’s shareholder proposal would directly and negatively impact the Company’s ongoing “litigation strategy”.</p>
<p>Deere is currently the subject of a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1274486/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class action lawsuit</a> from farmers who allege that Deere and its authorized dealerships have “attempted monopolization, exclusionary conduct and restraint in the repair service market for John Deere brand agricultural equipment.”</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Pressure and Broad Bipartisan Support Continues to Grow for Right to Repair</strong></p>
<p>Bipartisan Right to Repair legislation, like that passed in Colorado which allows <a href="https://apnews.com/article/colorado-right-to-repair-farming-equipment-1da00ea957fd1057bf522cb4725e62d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farmers</a> and <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wheelchair</a> users access to fix their own equipment, has been gaining momentum in the United States and in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/congress-takes-on-right-to-repair-consumer-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple bills</a> have been introduced in Congress that would give consumers broader access to repair.</p>
<p>President Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/24/remarks-by-president-biden-before-meeting-with-the-white-house-competition-council/#:~:text=Too%20many%20areas%2C%20if%20you,It&#039;s%20broke." target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicated supporting consumer’s right to repair</a>, stating that too often “if you own a product, from a smartphone to a tractor, you don’t have the freedom to choose how or where the repair that item you purchased.”</p>
<p>In addition to reducing costs and downtime, access to repair helps spur competition.</p>
<p>Deere has opposed allowing independent repair shops and farmers to fix equipment sold by Deere, citing emissions control concerns. The <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/the-epa-finally-refutes-john-deere-dealership-arguments-against-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPA</a> has rejected these concerns, and advocates point out that if farmers are limited in their repair options, they face increased costs and may miss critical harvesting deadlines.</p>
<p>Last November, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/deere-must-face-us-farmers-right-to-repair-lawsuits-judge-rules-2023-11-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. District Judge</a> in Illinois stated that Deere must face claims that it had conspired to restrict repairs.</p>
<p>“Green Century will continue to advocate for the right to repair,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate working on the issue. “Access to repair not only benefits consumers and the economy, but it is a critical environmental issue. Extending the lifespan of our equipment is one of the largest environmental contributions someone can make as an individual.”</p>

					<h2>Green Century° Files Shareholder Proposals Asking Major Hotels To Cut Plastic</h2>

<p>Plastic pollution, which often comes from single-use plastics, endangers the world’s most beautiful places by harming biodiversity.

<p>To address financial risk from plastic use, <a href="https://greencentury.com/">Green Century</a>° announced it has filed shareholder resolutions at major hotel brands Hilton*, Marriott*, and Choice Hotels* asking the companies to measure, disclose, and reduce their plastic use.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we are headed the exact wrong direction with plastic pollution,” said<strong> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</strong>. “Corporations have created a growing tidal wave of single-use plastic that is damaging our cherished coastlines.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_18883" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18883" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-18883 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Plastic-Waste-Chart.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="212" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18883" class="wp-caption-text">Plastic pollution has more than doubled in the past 20 years.

<p>While there are many causes of plastic pollution at our favorite destinations, the hotel industry is often overlooked. Hotels supply millions of single-use plastic bottles, bags, mini toiletry bottles, and cups wrapped in plastic each year. Experts suggest that <a href="https://sustainablehospitalityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Plastic-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32% of all plastic packaging ends up in the ocean</a>, and that at least <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/573b9090b654f9dc21f8a630/t/5bf91ac4352f534626c7c372/1543051980482/ABPCO.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> of plastic used by hotels and conferences is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Consumers are increasingly concerned by the single-use plastic crisis, with a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/75-people-want-single-use-plastics-banned-global-survey-finds-2022-02-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters global survey suggesting that 75% of the world’s population would support a single-use plastic ban</a>. Yet, hotel chains are lagging in acknowledging and addressing their contribution to the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;What gets measured gets managed, and these hotel chains are not measuring their plastic habit,” said<strong> Douglass Guernsey, a Green Century shareholder advocate working on the circular economy</strong>. “Hotels need to understand the amount of plastic waste they are creating and then set goals for reducing it.”</p>
<p>Single-use plastic regulations have gone into effect in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-02-27/the-eu-is-cracking-down-on-plastic-will-other-countries-follow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU</a>, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/accc11/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/india/india-bans-single-use-plastic-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">India</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/06/30/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-cutting-harmful-plastic-pollution-to-protect-communities-oceans-and-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and elsewhere around the <a href="https://www.globalplasticlaws.org/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world</a>. Also, investors are concerned that companies’ contributions to plastic pollution may affect shareholder value and cause environmental harm. <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/en/2023/05/investors-with-us10-trillion-aum-call-on-corporates-to-drastically-ramp-up-action-on-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investors representing US $10 trillion</a> in assets signed a statement in 2023 urging immediate cuts to single-use plastic.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18880" style="width: 624px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-18880 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ocean-Plastic.png" alt="" width="624" height="414" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18880" class="wp-caption-text">Plastic pollution is a major contributor to biodiversity loss</figcaption></figure>
<p>Measuring a company’s footprint can be complex, but it is an increasingly common practice. In 2023, <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/plastics/3-000-companies-disclose-plastic-impacts-for-the-first-time-ahead-of-landmark-global-plastics-treaty-negotiations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDP plastic</a>, the sustainability disclosure platform, saw companies worth US $31 trillion voluntarily share information related to their plastic footprint.</p>
<p>Green Century has worked with many notable brands to address corporate plastic footprints, including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/costco-steps-up-efforts-to-reduce-plastic-in-response-to-green-century-proposal/">Costco</a> which recently pledged to share the plastic footprint of its Kirkland Signature brand in Q3 of 2024.</p>
<p>“Nothing we use for less than a minute should pollute our environment for hundreds of years,” said Guernsey. “Our shareholder proposals ask Marriott, Hilton, and Choice to take the commonsense step of measuring their plastic footprints and figuring out what they can cut.”</p>

					<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong><br />
Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800<br />
Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, November 13)</strong> Green Century° announced today that it has joined major investors in signing two letters urging action on the UN Global Plastics Treaty. <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/plastics-treaty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The UN Global Plastics Treaty</a>, due to be completed in 2024, would create a legally binding international agreement to cover the entire life cycle of plastics.</p>
<p>“UN member countries have a once in a lifetime opportunity to confront the plastics pollution crisis,” said<strong> Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</strong> “We strongly support the highest level of ambition in the Global Plastic Treaty.”</p>
<p>Plastic pollution is seen as a worldwide crisis and market failure. Nearly 400 million tons of plastics are produced annually, primarily from fossil fuels, creating a carbon footprint of approximately 1.8 billion tons of emissions each year. Plastic is also known to have negative impacts on environmental and human health at every stage of its lifecycle.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18554" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18554" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-18554" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Plastic-GHG-Emissions-Graphic-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18554" class="wp-caption-text">(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, EPA)</figcaption></figure>
<h4>The estimated annual greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production worldwide is more than the emissions from 400 million cars, or greater than of all the cars in North America combined.</h4>
<p>The letter from the Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development to the High Ambition Coalition, signed by Green Century and nearly 30 other institutional investors, urges countries to create a comprehensive, binding agreement to address global plastic design, production, and disposal. It also calls for investments in refillable bottle systems to replace single use plastics.</p>
<p>The second letter, CDP’s Open Letter to Governments, endorsed by 48 financial institutions with over $3.5 trillion AUM, calls for mandatory plastic data disclosure by all plastic producers globally.</p>
<p>Progress has been made in recent years on plastic disclosure, yet many investors, corporations, and governments are still largely unaware of the types and quantities of plastics being produced. Requirements for better transparency are complicated by the more than 13,000 commonly used plastic additives which impact human health and decrease recyclability.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18557" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-18557 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Graph-Chemicals-Plastic.png" alt="" width="480" height="236" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18557" class="wp-caption-text">The Health Impact of Chemical Additives to Plastic Are Largely Unknown and Unregulated</figcaption></figure>
<h4><strong>Of the over 13,000 chemical additives to plastic, over 70% have adverse impacts on human health or have not yet been the subject of scientific studies. </strong></h4>
<p>“The more you learn about plastics, the clearer the risks become,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century.</strong> “Plastic additives increase health and litigation risk for businesses and make plastic harder to recycle. After mandatory disclosure, the next steps are plastic reduction and commonsense solutions like refillable bottles.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, June 16, 2023</strong> –  <a href="https://www.bldr.com/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Builders FirstSource</a>, the country’s largest building product supplier to the professional market, released the vote result from its annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday. Green Century° received a notable 21% of the vote in favor of its shareholder proposal, which asks the company to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. The proposal additionally asks the company to set goals for sourcing more renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency in its operations, and procuring zero-emission vehicles.</p>
<p>To implement science-based targets, the company would have to reduce its direct, operational emissions and its indirect emissions including from timber harvested for the lumber it sells. Over <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5000 companies</a>, including competitors <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/stories/fresh-thinking/lowes-science-based-net-zero-target-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/sustainability/home-depot-reduced-carbon-emissions-more-127000-metric-tons-2020-commits-100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, have committed to working with the Science Based Targets initiative, and nearly <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fortune-500-companies-are-acting-on-the-climate-crisis-but-is-it-enough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of all Fortune 500 companies have set some kind of climate change reduction target.</p>
<p>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a> said:</p>
<p>“Last year, we filed a nearly identical proposal at Builders asking for reduction targets which received a resounding ‘yes&#8217; vote from investors &#8211; but Builders took almost no action. The company <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001316835/579d09c7-0f03-4884-baa0-f9a54cd7af4e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relies heavily on timber</a>, which comes from forests that are significantly threatened by climate change. We believe management needs to start taking this risk seriously by measuring, disclosing, and setting reduction targets for its Scope 3 supply chain emissions.”</p>
<h4>Green Century Engaged with Builders FirstSource to Set First Emissions Reduction Targets</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century added:</p>
<p>“At the 11th hour, Builders disclosed its <a href="https://s202.q4cdn.com/867695273/files/doc_downloads/esg/Builders-FirstSource_2023-CSR-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scope 1 and 2 emissions</a>, which cover the direct emissions from its operations, and stated it will set emissions reduction targets for both these categories in 2025. While we appreciate that Builders is now taking action on a part of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-at-builders-firstsource-annual-meeting-green-century-wins-majority-vote-on-climate-change-proposal/">Green Century’s 2022 proposal</a>, the company has not yet measured, disclosed, or set targets for its Scope 3, or supply chain emissions, leaving investors in the dark for what comprises, on average, 75% of companies’ climate <a href="https://www.wri.org/update/trends-show-companies-are-ready-scope-3-reporting-us-climate-disclosure-rule#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%20account%20for%2075%25%20of%20companies,greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20on%20average" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions</a>.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>
