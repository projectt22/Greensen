					<p><b>(BOSTON) </b>Green Century° and Hilton Worldwide Holdings* reached a multi-year agreement for the major hotel chain to release an assessment of its single-use plastic by 2025 and set a plastic reduction goal by 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after competitors <a id="OWA8d5a00d0-04f6-7e87-8aae-8cc5e507a461" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/marriott-international-to-measure-cut-plastic-waste/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Marriott</a> and <a id="OWA7c7ba5ad-28f6-0034-d79a-25a6200cdd3c" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/choice-hotels-takes-first-step-in-tackling-plastic-pollution/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Choice Hotels</a> also agreed to measure and reduce single-use plastic, following agreements with Green Century.</p>
<p>“Neither Hilton nor its investors want to be stuck holding the bill for the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastic,” said <a id="OWA3a8141b8-fcc4-00d3-cbdf-c68eb0dca6d2" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds. “We applaud Hilton for committing to reduce its contribution to the plastic pollution crisis.”</p>
<h3><b>Plastic Pollution Crisis Continues to Grow</b></h3>
<p>Plastic pollution has been doubling every <a id="LPlnk561662" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six years</a>. Plastics don’t degrade, but break into small pieces called microplastics, which impact oceans, soil, the atmosphere, and human health.</p>
<p>“Consumers learn more everyday about the serious issues with plastic,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Companies need a strategy for the future beyond single-use plastic.”</p>
<p>Hilton, like its competitors, provides single-use plastic in its rooms, guest common spaces, and food service locations.</p>
<p>While the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastic have long alarmed scientists, the scale of crisis is just starting to be better understood by consumers.</p>
<p>According to a recent study, <a id="LPlnk643534" title="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seventy-five percent of Americans</a> want to see the private-sector offer plastic free options, and 72% agree that companies should stop producing and using so much single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Recycling may not be the solution it once promised. Only <a id="LPlnk" title="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastics</a> have been recycled, and many plastics aren&#8217;t recyclable at all, despite sporting the famous chasing arrows symbols.</p>
<p>Even plastics that are commonly recyclable, like #1 PET, <a id="LPlnk864054" title="https://pirg.org/articles/frequently-asked-questions-about-recycling-plastics/" href="https://pirg.org/articles/frequently-asked-questions-about-recycling-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pose significant challenges</a>. Color, size, shape, chemical additives, and downcycling prevent many plastics from being turned into new products.</p>

					<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Choice Hotels International*, one of the world&#8217;s leading lodging franchisors, has agreed to take the first step in addressing plastic pollution by conducting a program measure single-use plastic and develop strategies for single-use plastic reduction after engagement by Green Century°.</p>
<p>Choice Hotels, which has a diverse portfolio of 22 brands including Comfort Inn, Cambria Hotels, and Econo Lodge, will conduct a plastics reduction inventory program in 2024 and use it to set a new goal to reduce single-use plastic next year.</p>
<p>“As investors learn that plastic used for a minute can pollute our environment for hundreds of years, it has become a risk that companies need to manage,” said<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</a>. “We welcome Choice Hotel’s move to set a new plastic reduction goal.”</p>
<h4><strong>Choice Hotels, On of The Leading Lodging Franchisors, Agrees to Single-Use Plastic Study, Reduction</strong></h4>
<p>Choice Hotel’s commitment comes as consumers, investors, and regulators increasingly focus on the negative impacts of single-use plastic on the planet. According to a recent survey, 80% of U.S. respondents from across the political spectrum support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic.</p>
<p>“Delighting guests and reducing single-use plastics are clearly compatible,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</a>. “Customers want hospitality that doesn’t compromise the beauty of the places they might have traveled thousands of miles to visit.”</p>
<h4>It is estimated that two garbage trucks worth of plastic enter the ocean every minute.</h4>
<p>Recycling, long touted as the solution to the plastic waste crisis, has resulted in only 9% of plastic being recycled. Scientists and experts agree that the best way to reduce plastic pollution is to cut the amount of plastic companies are producing, and to replace non-essential single-use plastic with tested alternatives like reuseable containers.</p>
<p>“Choice is taking the first steps in addressing plastic pollution by better understanding how and how much plastic is used for its hotels,” added Guernsey. “The next step is to implement reductions, which will return long term value to consumers, the business, and investors.&#8221;</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> The Walt Disney Company* has agreed to disclose how much plastic it’s using in certain areas of its business and to set an additional plastic reduction goal, thanks to an agreement with Green Century Funds°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund. The Walt Disney Company will release its disclosures in 2025 and will publish the additional plastic reduction goal the following year. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<h4><span data-contrast="auto">The new commitments come as regulatory and economic pressures have pushed companies to disclose and reduce the use of non-essential single-use plastic.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It’s crucial that investors know how a company is addressing its environmental risks and Walt Disney’s commitment will provide important information through its new reporting,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</strong>. “It’s a win for the company since single-use plastic is widely unpopular with consumers who recognize that plastics will pollute our environment for generations to come.”  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Disney had previously taken significant steps towards reducing single-use plastic, including committing to eliminate single-use plastic on cruise ships by 2025, introducing plastic free packaging, and by committing to achieve zero waste to landfill for its wholly owned and operated parks and resorts by 2030.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These new commitments to disclose and to reduce unnecessary plastic will increase transparency and better position the company for a more sustainable future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“The green bottom line is that reducing plastic waste is a win for businesses and for the planet,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “Green Century is excited that the company is committed to these transparency measures that investors will value.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Plastic waste is one of the most durable and growing forms of pollution. It is estimated that every piece of plastic produced in the last 60 years that hasn’t been burned is still in the environment. According to a report from PEW Charitable Trust, if current plastic use trends continue, the amount of plastic leaking into oceans will triple, and the amount of plastic in the oceans will quadruple by 2040. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While many methods will be needed to reduce plastic pollution, recommendations from scientists and experts are for an absolute reduction of single-use plastic. Current recycling methods have resulted in only 9% of plastics being recycled, while most plastics labeled with the chasing arrow label are not actually recyclable. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Alternatives to non-essential single-use plastic already exist,” said Guernsey. “From refillable and reusable containers to recycled paper, corporations have options to reduce risk in this sector. Frankly, much of the single-use plastic we use is like the name states – non-essential.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
