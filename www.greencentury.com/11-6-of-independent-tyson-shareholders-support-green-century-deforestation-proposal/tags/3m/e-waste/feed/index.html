					<p><strong>(Boston) </strong>Microsoft Corporation* <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be offering extended security updates (ESU) for Microsoft Education customers at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century°</a>, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/microsoft-extends-security-support-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">pushed</a> Microsoft to announce affordable ESU for Windows 10 computers. This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest jump in junked computers ever</a>.</p>
<p>“This allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong>, President of <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century Funds</a>. “It is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.”</p>
<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/10/windows_11_adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">330-400 million devices</a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000 petition signatures</a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.</p>
<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.</p>
<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>
<p>“Getting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate. “We encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.”</p>

<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495<br />
Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA, 2023) &#8211; </strong>Following shareholder engagement by Green Century°, Alphabet* announced that it plans to extend software updates for Chromebooks for up to ten years starting in 2024, and that no existing Chromebooks will expire in the next two years. It is estimated the changes in policy could impact up to 120 million computers currently on the market.</p>
<p>The multiple year extension by the parent company of Google* allows schools and families to keep functioning Chromebooks to remain in use, preventing those items from becoming e-waste.</p>
<p>“This is a major win for the environment, schools, and the shareholder advocacy process,” said Douglass Guernsey, a Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management. “By extending the life of Chromebooks commonly used in schools, Alphabet is getting ahead of addressing potential risks and making sure hardware using its software can be used for as long as possible.”</p>
<h3><strong>Green Century and Consumer Activists Help Consumers and School Districts</strong></h3>
<p>Green Century discuss risks raised by the “<a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PIRG-Chromebook-Churn-Full-Report-May-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook Churn</a>” published by <a href="https://pirg.org/resources/what-is-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIRG</a> (Public Interest Research Groups) directly with Alphabet management in Summer 2023. Chromebook’s “Auto Update Expiration” date would cause millions of Chromebooks to stop working even if the hardware was still functioning. The report showed that extending the life of Chromebooks could result in <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/chromebook-churn-report-highlights-problems-of-short-lived-laptops-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 billion dollars</a> in savings for taxpayers and could save millions of tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Green Century has previously engaged Alphabet on improving reparability of its <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-withdraws-right-to-repair-shareholder-proposal-after-google-parent-alphabet-agrees-to-make-pixel-replacement-parts-available/">Pixel phones</a> and disclosing details of the company’s <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/google-parent-alphabet-pledges-greater-transparency-on-use-of-carbon-offsets-after-green-century-shareholder-proposal-2/">carbon offsets</a>. Both previous engagements resulted in changes from management to address environmental concerns.</p>

					<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA, 2023)</strong> In a reversal of its stance, <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc.*</a> announced Wednesday that it now supports the Right to Repair Act progressing through the California Legislature despite past opposition to giving consumers and repair shops the tools they need to fix devices.</p>
<p>Introduced by state Sen. Susan Eggman (D-Stockton), <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Bill 244</a> would make it easier and cheaper to get consumer electronics and appliances fixed. Under the bill, manufacturers like Apple must provide consumers or independent repair shops with sufficient documentation, tools, and parts. This bill would also reduce the e-waste currently filling landfills as consumers would be able to repair instead of discarding or upgrading their devices.</p>
<p>Apple, <a href="https://www.fool.com/research/largest-companies-by-market-cap/#:~:text=of%20August%202023.-,Key%20findings,and%20Amazon%20(%241.32%20trillion)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest company in the world</a>, had previously opposed allowing users to repair its products, until Green Century and others began negotiations with the company. Green Century’s engagement<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/"> helped secure an agreement with Apple in 2021</a> that stated, for the first time, that Apple would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products.</p>
<p>“We are excited that Apple has announced its support for this important legislation and recognize this is a major step forward for the company,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate with Green Century Capital Management. “By supporting this legislation, Apple is sending a strong message that repairing, not replacing products, is good for consumers, good for the environment, and good for investors.”</p>
<p><strong>California Legislation Part of National Momentum</strong></p>
<p>Apple indicated its support for offering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely, while ensuring they wouldn’t risk privacy or data issues.</p>
<p>“Apple supports California’s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy,” the company says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</a></p>
<p>The bill specifies that the duration of a manufacturer’s obligation would depend on the product’s cost. Those with a wholesale price of at least $50 would have a shorter time than products that cost more than $100, where the bill specifies that access to documentation tools and parts must be available for seven years.</p>
<p>The California State Assembly has been debating the bill and a vote is expected shortly in the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The bill cleared the state Senate in May by a 38-0 vote.</p>
<p>California has been a leader in the Right to Repair movement, with momentum increasing nationally as lawmakers from about 14 states have introduced similar bills. <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/right-to-repair-in-2022-what-happened-in-new-york-and-our-top-accomplishments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>, <a href="https://pirg.org/updates/colorado-tractor-right-to-repair-signed-into-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado </a>and <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/minnesota-passes-broadest-right-to-repair-measure-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota</a> all passed their own Right to Repair laws in the past year.</p>
<p>A coalition <a href="https://pirg.org/california/updates/82-repair-shops-sign-letter-in-support-of-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of 82 repair shops have rallied behind the bill, which was backed by CalPIRG</a>, one of the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ownership-2-pager-6.30.23.pdf">nonprofit owners</a> of Green Century.</p>
<p><a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/repair-saves-families-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to research by PIRG</a>, the average American family generates about 115 pounds of electronic waste each year, and nationally, the United States generates 6.9 million tons of electronic waste.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					<p>(Boston, MA) &#8211; In a positive development for the Right to Repair movement, technology giant <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a>* announced it would expand its Self Service Repair program to its newest iPhone 14 and M2 Mac models. The company’s continued commitment is a win for consumer rights and efforts to combat e-waste and came after <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century Funds</a>°, a leading environmentally responsible family of mutual funds, advocated for increasing sustainable business practices at the company.</p>
<p>Green Century initiated discussions with Apple in 2021 and submitted a shareholder proposal later that year asking the company to consider the environmental and social benefits of making its devices more easily repairable by consumers and independent repair shops.</p>
<h2><strong>Green Century Advocacy Creates Long-Term Impact for the Environment </strong></h2>
<p>Through a series of collaborative meetings, Green Century provided Apple with compelling evidence on the positive environmental implications of allowing customers to repair instead of replacing their products. Repairs extend the life of products, help reduce electronic and plastic waste, promote a more circular economy, and aligns Apple’s policy on the issue with its own sustainability goals and commitments.</p>
<p>Green Century’s efforts helped to culminate in Apple announcing for the first time in 2021 that it would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products. Green Century withdrew its shareholder proposal in return for Apple’s commitments.</p>
<p>“True to its slogan, Apple is “Thinking Different” by helping to reduce electronic waste and helping customers hold on to their products longer. Green Century is proud to have played a role in Apple&#8217;s evolving support for Right to Repair and hope that their leadership moves its competitors to follow suit,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</p>
<p>Apple and other technology companies traditionally have lobbied against Right to Repair legislation, so the announcement of its expanded repair commitments carries substantial weight in industry discussions. Americans spend around <a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,700</a> per household a year purchasing new electronic devices, and nearly<a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 7 million tons</a> of American <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/what-is-e-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic e-waste</a> end up in landfills each year.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, April 27, 2022 – </strong>Apple officially <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apples-self-service-repair-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched </a>its long-awaited Self-Service Repair program Wednesday, five months after announcing the program at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787336/apple-right-to-repair-self-service-diy-reason-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prompting </a>of a Green Century shareholder proposal. U.S.-based consumers can now access repair manuals and purchase more than 200 parts and tools for fixing iPhone 12, 13, and SE 3 models.</p>



<p>The announcement of the program was a reversal in course for Apple, which has historically opposed the Right to Repair. While there are promising aspects, particularly the free availability of repair manuals, investors have remaining concerns about how the program will be run and how Apple is still maintaining tight control over the repair of its products.</p>



<p>Unlike similar initiatives announced by Google and Samsung, Apple is requiring consumers to pair replacement parts to the serial number of the device being repaired. This will continue to make it difficult for independent repair shops to perform iPhone repairs and will pose challenges to refurbishers who want to repair phones after Apple stops officially supporting the model. As <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/59239/apples-self-repair-vision-is-here-and-its-got-a-catch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted </a>by repair organization iFixit, this “essentially puts an expiration date on iPhones.”</p>



<p><strong>Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century Capital Management,<em>°</em> released the following statement</strong>:</p>



<p>“The launch of Apple’s repair program today is a promising step forward for the company and should provide some comfort to investors that Apple is working to mitigate the regulatory risks posed by potential Right to Repair regulations from the Federal Trade Commission and state legislatures.</p>



<p>“However, this program does not sufficiently address our concerns related to the reputational and environmental risks posed by the electronic waste and greenhouse gas emissions associated with premature device disposal. Apple should take steps to eliminate the ‘parts pairing’ element of the program to ensure company devices can reach their full lifespan potential.”</p>
