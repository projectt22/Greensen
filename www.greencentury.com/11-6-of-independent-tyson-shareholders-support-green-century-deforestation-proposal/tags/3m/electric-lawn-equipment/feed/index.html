<p>Andrew Shalit, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:ashalit@greencentury.com">ashalit@greencentury.com</a>, 617-747-4439</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, April 25, 2024 </strong>– National retailers Walmart and Tractor Supply Company will not allow shareholders to vote on proposals to disclose more information about the sources of each company’s planet-warming emissions. The move comes after the SEC notified the companies that they could exclude the shareholder proposals filed by Green Century Capital Management from their annual meeting agenda.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed that Walmart and Tractor Supply have decided not to allow shareholders to weigh in on whether the companies should reveal more about their products’ carbon emissions,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century. “These companies sell both highly polluting products and cleaner alternatives. Investors deserve to know how these stores are managing their product portfolios as we transition to a low-carbon economy.”</p>
<p>If implemented, Green Century’s proposals would have provided important insight into the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the products sold at the stores, such as gasoline powered lawn mowers and leaf blowers.</p>
<p><strong>Most Emissions Come from Products, Not Stores</strong></p>
<p>Pollution from the production and use of retail products is a major contributor to <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&amp;discloser_id=988600&amp;locale=en&amp;organization_name=Walmart%2C+Inc.&amp;organization_number=20402&amp;program=Investor&amp;project_year=2022&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F186745&amp;survey_id=78646008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart </a>and <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/539497486/files/doc_financials/2022/sr/7-12-23-TSCO23-ESG-Tear-Sheet-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tractor Supply’s </a>overall carbon footprint. And while both companies provide a breakdown of their emissions from operations, they do not disclose which product categories are responsible for the emissions caused by the products that they sell. Product emissions are many times greater than operational emissions.</p>

<p>“Walmart and Tractor Supply have an opportunity to shed light on the climate pollution from their products,” said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “We hope the companies will follow the example set by Lowe’s and provide this additional information.”</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/lowes-to-increase-disclosure-of-climate-emissions-data/">Lowe’s agreed to provide this expanded disclosure </a>in response to outreach and discussion with Green Century.</p>
