					<p><strong>(Boston) </strong>Microsoft Corporation* <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be offering extended security updates (ESU) for Microsoft Education customers at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century°</a>, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/microsoft-extends-security-support-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">pushed</a> Microsoft to announce affordable ESU for Windows 10 computers. This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest jump in junked computers ever</a>.</p>
<p>“This allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong>, President of <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century Funds</a>. “It is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.”</p>
<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/10/windows_11_adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">330-400 million devices</a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000 petition signatures</a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.</p>
<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.</p>
<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>
<p>“Getting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate. “We encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.”</p>

					<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA, 2023)</strong> In a reversal of its stance, <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc.*</a> announced Wednesday that it now supports the Right to Repair Act progressing through the California Legislature despite past opposition to giving consumers and repair shops the tools they need to fix devices.</p>
<p>Introduced by state Sen. Susan Eggman (D-Stockton), <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Bill 244</a> would make it easier and cheaper to get consumer electronics and appliances fixed. Under the bill, manufacturers like Apple must provide consumers or independent repair shops with sufficient documentation, tools, and parts. This bill would also reduce the e-waste currently filling landfills as consumers would be able to repair instead of discarding or upgrading their devices.</p>
<p>Apple, <a href="https://www.fool.com/research/largest-companies-by-market-cap/#:~:text=of%20August%202023.-,Key%20findings,and%20Amazon%20(%241.32%20trillion)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest company in the world</a>, had previously opposed allowing users to repair its products, until Green Century and others began negotiations with the company. Green Century’s engagement<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/"> helped secure an agreement with Apple in 2021</a> that stated, for the first time, that Apple would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products.</p>
<p>“We are excited that Apple has announced its support for this important legislation and recognize this is a major step forward for the company,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate with Green Century Capital Management. “By supporting this legislation, Apple is sending a strong message that repairing, not replacing products, is good for consumers, good for the environment, and good for investors.”</p>
<p><strong>California Legislation Part of National Momentum</strong></p>
<p>Apple indicated its support for offering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely, while ensuring they wouldn’t risk privacy or data issues.</p>
<p>“Apple supports California’s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy,” the company says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</a></p>
<p>The bill specifies that the duration of a manufacturer’s obligation would depend on the product’s cost. Those with a wholesale price of at least $50 would have a shorter time than products that cost more than $100, where the bill specifies that access to documentation tools and parts must be available for seven years.</p>
<p>The California State Assembly has been debating the bill and a vote is expected shortly in the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The bill cleared the state Senate in May by a 38-0 vote.</p>
<p>California has been a leader in the Right to Repair movement, with momentum increasing nationally as lawmakers from about 14 states have introduced similar bills. <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/right-to-repair-in-2022-what-happened-in-new-york-and-our-top-accomplishments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>, <a href="https://pirg.org/updates/colorado-tractor-right-to-repair-signed-into-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado </a>and <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/minnesota-passes-broadest-right-to-repair-measure-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota</a> all passed their own Right to Repair laws in the past year.</p>
<p>A coalition <a href="https://pirg.org/california/updates/82-repair-shops-sign-letter-in-support-of-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of 82 repair shops have rallied behind the bill, which was backed by CalPIRG</a>, one of the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ownership-2-pager-6.30.23.pdf">nonprofit owners</a> of Green Century.</p>
<p><a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/repair-saves-families-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to research by PIRG</a>, the average American family generates about 115 pounds of electronic waste each year, and nationally, the United States generates 6.9 million tons of electronic waste.</p>

<p>Media Contacts: Josh Chetwynd, jchetwynd@greencentury.com, 303-573-5558; Annalisa Tarizzo, atarizzo@greencentury.com, 781-349-2789</p>



<p><strong>Boston, March 24, 2022 – </strong>Green Century<em>°</em> has withdrawn a shareholder proposal with Dell Technologies after the company published a <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/corporate/social-impact/advancing-sustainability/sustainable-products-and-services/circular-design.htm#scroll=off&amp;pdf-overlay=//www.dell.com/content/dam/documents-and-videos/dv1/en/solutions/business-solutions/briefs-summaries/design-for-environment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">position statement</a> that outlines its approach to product repair and circular design. In an accompanying <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/repair-reuse-recycle-the-circular-economy-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, the company highlights its definition of repairability and notes its longstanding support of its “customers’ choice to repair their own device.”</p>



<p>While Dell has long provided customers and independent repair shops with access to such repair resources as manuals and replacement parts, the company had never directly articulated its support for product repair choices. Given the growing momentum of the Right to Repair movement and increasing attention from regulators and legislators on the issue of manufacturers restricting repair to their own authorized servicers, investors wanted assurance that Dell is prepared to continue its industry-leading efforts to make product repair accessible.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to see Dell take a more explicit position on its efforts to enable product repair,” said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “We believe that remaining actively engaged in the Right to Repair conversation is critical for technology companies, from both a reputational and a regulatory perspective.”</p>



<p>In the last year, Right to Repair legislation has been introduced in 27 states and in the U.S. Congress. In July, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing the Federal Trade Commission to develop rules on “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair.”</p>



<p>Although the company leads industry peers like Apple* and Alphabet’s* Google on repair accessibility, investors remain concerned about Dell’s affiliation with industry trade groups such as TechNet and the Consumer Technology Association, which routinely lobby against Right to Repair reforms.</p>



<p>“Even industry leaders have room for improvement,” Tarizzo added. “We urge Dell to distance itself from trade groups whose lobbying activities run counter to its position on product repair.”</p>
