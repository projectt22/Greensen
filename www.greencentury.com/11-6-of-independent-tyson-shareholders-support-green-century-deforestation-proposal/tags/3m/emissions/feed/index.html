<p><strong>Boston, June 11, 2025 </strong>– Columbia Sportswear’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century<em>° </em>shareholder proposal requesting that the company set climate emissions reduction targets. The proposal received 7.9% of votes cast.</p>



<p>“Columbia would better serve its investors and bottom line by cutting its climate impact, like so many of its peers have done,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Climate action is a priority for many of Columbia’s outdoorsy customers, so it should be a priority for Columbia.”</p>



<p><a></a>In 2020, the owner of several active lifestyle brands <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/309/columbia-sportswear-company-releases-2020-corporate?ef_id=2efa76054317110b878d1542bfa78f26%3AG%3As" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to cut the climate footprint</a> of its manufacturing by 30%, but the company quietly stopped reporting on its commitment in 2022. Columbia has not indicated that it will adopt a new goal to keep up with the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">649 </a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footwear and apparel companies</a> that have agreed to or already set science-based emissions reduction targets as of May 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Columbia falls behind its mission and peers</strong></p>



<p><a></a>Without action, the footwear and apparel industry by 2050 could account for <a href="https://content.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/m/7f818b40f06e1afd/original/Summary-of-findings-A-New-Textiles-Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a quarter</a> of the global climate emissions necessary to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/2024-was-warmest-year-modern-record-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 was the warmest year</a> on record and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/when-risks-become-reality-extreme-weather-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists say</a> climate change added 41 days of dangerous heat and worsened the severity of flooding.</p>



<p>Consumer concern about climate change is rising with the temperature. A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PricewaterhouseCoopers survey</a> found that more than 80% of consumers say they are willing to pay more for sustainably produced goods, and some would be willing to pay 9.7% more for goods that meet environmental standards. Nine out of ten Gen Zers born between 1996 and 2010 believe that companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-gen-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey study</a>.</p>



<p>Columbia’s mission is to “unlock the outdoors for everyone.” Nevertheless, while Columbia stays silent on climate commitments, its competitors &#8212; including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia,</a> <a href="https://www.vfc.com/responsibility/planet/climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VF Corp</a>*, and <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/meet-brooks/running-responsibly/climate-action/?srsltid=AfmBOoqMK8jgLJzsGhpwmQ2R1kjF11jnwNMHvdGvMjxHHUFWqxm91UWJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooks</a> &#8212; have set climate emissions reduction goals that demonstrate they are working to protect the environment their customers value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Columbia <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/372/columbia-sportswear-company-reports-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=our%20conference%20call.-,ACCELERATE%20Growth%20Strategy,as%20enhanced%20ways%20of%20working." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to attract</a> young, active consumers, yet it has backtracked on its ambition to protect the very outdoors they want to experience,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The company could boost its reputation and competitive edge if it took further steps to protect Earth, not just use it in its advertising.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 14.8% of votes cast on Wednesday supported a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the insurer Markel Group to disclose the climate emissions from its underwriting, investing and insuring activities. The Virginia-based company has grown from <a href="https://www.mklgroup.com/who-we-are/our-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering small buses</a> to insuring a range of properties from boats to <a href="https://www.markel.com/international/london/energy/downstream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oil refineries</a> over its 95 years of operation.  </p>



<p>“Insurers’ pursuit of short-term profits from fossil fuels guarantees long-term environmental and financial costs,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.&nbsp;</strong> “It makes no sense for any business to willingly and knowingly contribute to something &#8212; in this case, climate change &#8212; that causes such large payouts. Investors deserve to know how Markel’s emissions drive the climate risks its business is losing money from.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/is-climate-change-increasing-the-risk-of-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural disasters increase</a> in frequency and severity due to climate change, so do the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulties insurers face in pricing risk</a> and recovering losses from climate disasters. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2023 <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded $100 billion</a> for the fourth consecutive year and the Swiss Re Group projects they could <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double within the next ten years</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impacts of increasing emissions extend to homeowners as well. Insurers are increasingly abandoning areas vulnerable to climate change-fueled severe weather by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/18/homeowners-insurance-california-florida-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to renew policies</a> at the end of their term. A congressional investigation revealed that climate change has spurred <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiking non-renewal rates</a> by insurers and <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher premiums</a> for customers. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more th</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 counties</a> across the United States, the rate of non-renewal has tripled or more since 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Markel is quiet on climate impact&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a professed <a href="https://www.markel.com/about-us/company-responsibility#5927E3E9394A46A29A73467F1A9B4CA4-tab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to environmental stewardship</a>, Markel does not report any of its climate emissions or publish an annual sustainability report. This places the company far behind competitors including <a href="https://asset.trvstatic.com/download/assets/Travelers_TCFDReport2023.pdf/93114e88b97011efa5e28e42e80f1a8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travelers</a>* and <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIG</a>, both of which disclose their operational emissions and are expanding efforts to measure the emissions associated with their investments. Markel is also out of step with the vast majority of other companies in the Russell 1000 index – which represents the biggest companies in the U.S. – 93% of which published a <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/nc/storage/press-releases/article/ga-institutes-research-shows-2023-sustainability-reporting-at-record-levels-as-us-public-compani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustainability report in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, investors and consumers will foot the bill for Markel’s lack of transparency and failure to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Understanding the scope of Markel’s unwriting, investing and insuring of fossil fuels is the first step in responding to these risks to both pocketbooks and the planet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 – </strong>5.7% of shareholder votes were cast in favor of a shareholder proposal asking Foot Locker* to set climate emissions reduction targets at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. Green Century° and <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a><em> </em>filed the proposal.  </p>



<p>“Without climate targets, investors are in the dark about Foot Locker’s plans to mitigate climate risk,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Setting a goal to cut planet-warming emissions shows that Foot Locker is working to reduce its climate impact, not just measure it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/f4606fc1-6d5b-46c9-b175-2cd50429c30e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker committed</a> to setting climate emissions reduction targets and a net-zero goal in response to an <em>As You Sow </em>shareholder proposal. The company quietly retracted its commitment this year in its <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact report</a> and has not shared plans to adopt new climate targets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Climate change threatens footwear and apparel companies&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Footwear and apparel companies are expected to experience significant impacts as climate change intensifies. Asia is the “<a href="https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/asia-still-garment-factory-world-yet-faces-numerous-challenges-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garment factory of the world</a>,” according to the International Labor Organization, as well as the world’s <a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-asia-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most disaster-prone region</a>. Climate disasters could <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-state-of-fashion-2024-report-climate-crisis-supply-chain-sustainability-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten $65 billion worth of apparel exports</a> from countries critical to footwear and apparel production by 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/node/21641/html#item1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s disclosures</a> warn that climate-related hazards could disrupt production and delivery. The vast majority of <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s suppliers</a> for its brand-named products, totaling 90 percent, are sourced from climate-vulnerable countries in Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Foot Locker out of step with industry</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six hundred and forty footwear and apparel retailers, such as <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/impact/initiatives/reducing-our-carbon-footprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nike*,</a> <a href="https://sustainability.decathlon.com/what-action-plan-is-needed-to-reduce-absolute-co2-eq-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decathalon</a> and <a href="https://www.jdplc.com/esg/environment/climate-change/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JD Sports</a>, have set or committed to setting science-based targets to reduce their climate emissions and associated risks. <a href="https://earth.org/what-is-the-united-nations-fashion-industry-charter-for-climate-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nearly 130 apparel companies</a> have signed on to the <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/sectoral-engagement-for-climate-action/fashion-charter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Nation’s Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,</a> which requires adopting science-based targets and collaborating on plans to reach them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 10.5% of McDonald’s* shareholders cast their votes in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to assess whether its existing climate policies and plans are sufficient to achieve its emissions reduction targets. The resolution, which went to the ballot Tuesday, requests details on McDonald’s progress toward reaching its net-zero emissions by 2050 goal</p>



<p>“McDonald’s commitment to reducing carbon pollution shows that the company understands the risks that a warming planet poses to its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Now, McDonald’s must assure investors that it will live up to its commitments and take the necessary steps to meaningfully reduce climate-related risks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef has an outsized climate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/food-systems-responsible-for-one-third-of-human-caused-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our food system</a> accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and few meals we eat contribute to those emissions more than a burger. The life cycle of beef from farm to fork<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emits more greenhouse gas emissions</a> per kilogram than any other food, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular fast-food restaurants can play a key role in addressing climate change by buying and selling beef produced with processes that reduce emissions. Chains including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have added alternative-protein patties to their menus. Diversifying protein options to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption of beef is one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical method to cutting climate emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>McDonald’s </strong><strong>is slow </strong><strong>to show progress&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s set short- and long-term targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with what science says is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Because beef makes up about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/the-carbon-footprint-of-mcdonald-s-menu-very-big" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of the company&#8217;s total climate footprint</a>, reducing beef-related emissions is an impactful strategy to achieve its climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the climate risks of increasing emissions, McDonald’s is exposing itself to reputational risk by failing to illustrate it is on track to meet its climate commitments. <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/greenwashing-rising-report-rep-risk-social-washing-sustainability/696289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental groups </a>have suggested companies, <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/mcdonalds-greenwashing-2655223811.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including McDonald’s</a>, may be misleading customers about the extent of their climate action, a phenomenon called “greenwashing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s has several initiatives to decrease the emissions from beef production. These plans aim to<a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce beef more sustainably</a> and<a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve soil’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide</a>. Still, the company <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/the-mcplant-is-out-but-the-mcrib-will-be-back-heres-when/476654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinued its only plant-based burger</a> in the United States, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its largest </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market</a> in terms of system-wide sales, signaling alternative proteins may not be a part of its approach to cutting climate emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“McDonald’s lacks alternative protein options that would help it reduce its beef-related emissions and demonstrate progress toward achieving its goals,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>hareholder </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>dvocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The happiest meal for investors is one that shows the company is reducing emissions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 </strong>– 5.1% of voting shares were cast on Wednesday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking Wendy’s for more details on how the company will achieve its sustainability goals. The fast food chain has pledged to reduce the climate impact of emissions drivers such as beef production across farms, franchises and other links in its supply chain.</p>



<p>“Investors want to know Wendy&#8217;s has a viable strategy to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Plans that directly address the highest-emitting parts of Wendy’s business are critical to making its climate roadmap a reality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef is a major climate emitter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all the goods Wendy’s purchases, beef is the main offender in increasing emissions. The United Nations reports that beef <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emits</a> more greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram than any other food. <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beef accounts for 58%</a> of the total emissions from the goods and services Wendy’s purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendys-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2023</a>, Wendy&#8217;s announced its first goals to reduce emissions from purchased goods and services and franchises by 2030. Reducing the climate footprint of its “fresh, never frozen” burgers is key to Wendy’s reaching its new, <a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> climate </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targets</a>, and the company identifies <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beef as one of four emissions </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot spots</a>.” Nevertheless, emissions from Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2024-05/Wendys-2023-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased goods and services have increased</a> since 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Wendy’s climate plans lack key details</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wendy’s sustainability report highlights steps to <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve its climate commitment— primarily through increasing innovation</a> rather than decreasing beef consumption. The company cites manure management and feed efficiency as key initiatives to cut emissions but lacks details about how specific projects, collaborations, or investments will make its emissions reduction plans a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Competitors including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have already taken steps that will reduce emissions from beef, such as introducing alternative proteins to their menus. Burger King’s Impossible<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Whopper <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/responsible-sourcing/beef-cow-methane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generates 89% fewer emissions</a> than a beef burger, helping the restaurant reach its own <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/planet/climate-action/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">climate commitment</a>. Although Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features “product mix”</a> as part of its roadmap to reduce emissions, it does not describe what this strategy entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wendy’s ambition to reduce its climate footprint will only benefit its business if it becomes reality,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Investors want to know more details on how the company plans to hit its climate goals.

<p>Amazon does not report emissions <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with 99% of the company’s retail sales</a><strong><em>.</em></strong> Unlike its peers <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/esgreport/our-esg-priorities/2023%20CDP%20Climate%20Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mobilecontent.costco.com/staging/resource/img/25w03130/5a_ClimateActionPlan_FY24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco</a>* and <a href="https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/c70c48ab-0e10-4576-9e92-789e30665964/2023-CDP-Climate-Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target</a>*, the company only publishes the emissions of its Amazon-branded products, which make up a mere 1% of retail <a href="https://www.momentumcommerce.com/amazons-private-label-market-share-shrinks-by-6-year-over-year-in-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a>.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s emissions disclosures do not align with the global standard for corporate greenhouse gas reporting, which its major peers are following,” <strong>said Parker Caswell, climate and energy senior associate at <em>As You Sow</em>. </strong>&#8220;Amazon must live up to investor expectations and report more than the emissions from products that make up just <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of its sales</a>.”</p>



<p>Despite investor concern, and coming regulations in <a href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/sustainability-reporting-and-auditing-scope-3-supplier-emissions#DoScope3EmissionsNeedToBeReported" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the European Union</a> (EU) and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> that may mandate more detailed disclosures, Amazon has not indicated it will improve its reporting.</p>



<p><strong>Amazon fails to measure up to climate commitments</strong></p>



<p>The retail sector is responsible for <a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-retailer-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% of global greenhouse gas emissions,</a> which means large retailers can play a crucial role in tackling the climate crisis. Amazon recognized this in declaring its <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/planet/climate-pledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious target to cut emissions</a> by 2040, citing the need for meaningful action to halt climate change.</p>



<p>While Amazon has set targets to tackle climate change, it has also faced <a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/why-amazons-own-employees-are-calling-it-out-for-greenwashing-ff7ace354cb7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaints from its employees</a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250314136610/en/Hagens-Berman-Amazon-Faces-Consumer-Lawsuit-Alleging-Deforestation-Behind-Amazon-Basics-Paper-Products-and-Greenwashing-Cover-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal challenges from customers</a> on the accuracy of its climate disclosures and marketing.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s climate mitigation efforts should match the scale of its business, “<strong> said</strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong> </strong></a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“It’s time for Amazon to live up to its own climate ambition and investor expectations for mitigating climate-related risks.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 16, 2025</strong> – A Green Century° shareholder proposal requesting that Skyworks Solutions* disclose its full contribution to climate change received 21.9% of votes cast at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. The semiconductor manufacturer supplies major technology companies including Apple* , Google* and Microsoft* with materials that power billions of electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops.</p>



<p>“Investors need a more complete understanding of a business’ contribution and exposure to climate risk to understand potential effects on their investments,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“By disclosing the majority of its emissions, Skyworks would catch up to industry standards and meet investor expectations.”</p>



<p><strong>Skyworks lags competitors and customers on climate ambition</strong></p>



<p>The semiconductor industry accounted for <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much climate pollution as half of U.S. households</a><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> combined</a><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2023</a>. About <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/a-plan-to-reduce-semiconductor-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% of a semiconductor’s climate footprint</a> comes from across its supply chain, including raw materials and device use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of Skyworks’ peers are reducing their impact on climate change. NXP Semiconductors* and Applied Materials* are among more than <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10,000 companies</a> that have set science-based climate emissions reduction targets. In addition, more than 60 semiconductor companies founded the <a href="https://www.semi.org/en/industry-groups/semiconductor-climate-consortium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semiconductor Climate Consortium</a> to mitigate emissions from the industry.</p>



<p>Skyworks’ largest customers also surpass the company in their climate commitments. Apple, which <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405602-skyworks-solutions-downgraded-at-argus-on-apple-worries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accounted for 69% of Skyworks’ net revenue</a> in 2024, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aims to be carbon neutral by 2030</a>, and other customers such as <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/climate-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> have equally ambitious targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Disclosing climate emissions increases transparency and drives action</strong></p>



<p>Measuring full value-chain emissions helps companies identify the largest sources of greenhouse gases across their operations and supply chain. It is also a crucial first step toward setting targets and implementing actions to reduce emissions.</p>



<p>Although Skyworks has disclosed its operational emissions and emissions from business travel, these are <a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely</a><a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> to account for less than 10%</a><a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a>of the company’s overall impact on climate change based on competitors’ disclosures. <a href="https://www.appliedmaterials.com/eu/en/corporate-responsibility/planet/net-zero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peers that report a more complete emissions inventory</a> show that supply-chain and device use emissions typically comprise more than 90% of a semiconductor’s climate impact.</p>



<p>“Skyworks disclosing its full value-chain emissions would signal its intent to catch up to competitors and meet its customers’ expectations for climate action,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Continuing to trail the industry creates reputational, competitive, and climate risks that threaten its bottom line and the planet.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 16, 2025</strong> – Chubb’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century° shareholder proposal calling for the company to disclose the climate emissions associated with its investing, underwriting and insuring activities. 13.9% of shareholders cast their votes in favor of the proposal. Chubb is one of the<a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/chubb/67002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> largest publicly traded property and casualty insurers</a>, operating in 55 countries across the globe.</p>



<p>“Investors deserve to know how Chubb’s emissions are driving the climate risks disrupting its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “It’s absurd for Chubb to underwrite activities that cause climate change and then turn around and pay for the claims and payouts caused by these activities.”</p>



<p><a></a>As climate change intensifies, <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/01/09/807524.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurers are increasingly on the hook</a> after more frequent and severe natural disasters. At the same time, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-01-31/insurance-companies-fossil-fuel-industry-eaton-palisades-fire-essential-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many continue to insure fossil fuel projects</a> that exacerbate the losses from those events. Many major insurance companies such as <a href="https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allianz</a> and <a href="https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:52d75760-2c43-4d96-be2f-0514382ac51a/2023-sustainability-report-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Re</a>* have begun disclosing the emissions associated with their fossil fuel clients, increasing transparency on their role in intensifying the climate crisis.</p>



<p><strong>Chubb insures climate risks</strong></p>



<p>Last year’s wildfires in Los Angeles and destructive hurricane season in the Atlantic have sparked concern about a climate-driven insurance crisis. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 had the most billion-dollar climate-related disasters</a> in one year. Insurance companies are increasingly unable to withstand growing losses without raising prices or reducing coverage in high-risk areas.</p>



<p>Chubb has noticed the impact of climate change on its bottom line. Following an estimated <a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/chubb-estimates-1-5bn-loss-from-la-wildfires-amid-reduced-california-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 billion dollars in losses</a> from the 2024 California fires, Chubb’s Chief Executive Evan Greenberg warned: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pricier-insurance-makes-sense-as-climate-risk-grows-chubb-ceo-says-5e5d53b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The cost of climate change, to state the obvious: Going up.”</a></p>



<p>“The companies that are supposed to protect us from the consequences of climate change are also fueling its disastrous effects,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Chubb reporting the emissions from its underwriting, investing, and insuring would demonstrate accountability and an intent to reduce its climate impact.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 15, 2025</strong> – On May 21, Amazon shareholders will vote on a proposal asking Amazon to disclose the total climate emissions associated with its retail sales. This is the second year Green Century<em>°</em> and shareholder representative <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a> are requesting that Amazon more comprehensively measure the greenhouse gas footprint of the products that contribute to its retail sales.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s status as a dominant global retailer means its products have a massive climate impact,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Failing to report full product emissions is failing to disclose significant climate risk to investors.”</p>



<p><strong>Amazon’s climate footprint exceeds its reporting efforts</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retail sector is responsible for <a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-retailer-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% </a>of global greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the largest U.S. retailers, including <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/esgreport/our-esg-priorities/2023%20CDP%20Climate%20Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mobilecontent.costco.com/staging/resource/img/25w03130/5a_ClimateActionPlan_FY24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco</a>* and <a href="https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/c70c48ab-0e10-4576-9e92-789e30665964/2023-CDP-Climate-Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target</a>,* already measure and report emissions from the majority of their products.</p>



<p>Amazon only discloses <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the emissions related to its Amazon-branded products</a>, which comprise <a href="https://www.momentumcommerce.com/amazons-private-label-market-share-shrinks-by-6-year-over-year-in-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 1% of its total sales</a>.&nbsp;This excludes a significant amount of Amazon’s products—and their climate impact.</p>



<p>“Despite Amazon being an <a href="https://nrf.com/research-insights/top-retailers/top-50-global-retailers/top-50-global-retailers-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international leader in retail sales</a>, the company lags in emissions reporting,” said<strong> Parker Caswell, </strong><strong>climate and energy senior associate at As You Sow</strong>. “This limited reporting makes Amazon’s emissions appear much smaller than they actually are.”</p>



<p>“Amazon’s lack of transparency about its climate pollution leaves investors in the dark about the company’s exposure to climate risk,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Information on risk is a foundation of disclosures and something every shareholder and potential shareholder deserves: The climate-related risks of Amazon’s total greenhouse gas emissions are no exception.”</p>
