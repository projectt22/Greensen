										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p aria-level="4">Even though I knew for months that an ESG firm was thinking about removing its exclusion on nuclear power producers, I was taken aback when I read their press release. Why would they revert their position and turn to nuclear when investing in renewable energy has grown so dramatically?</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In reading their statement, I didn’t find any satisfactory explanations. Yet this sentence struck me: </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">We believe nuclear energy offers a critical source of fuel, with benefits that include … safety.”  Safety. Let’s start with that. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19354 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/frederic-paulussen-LWnD8U2OReU-unsplash-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></span></b></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Safety. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">The designs for nuclear plants are varied, and there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built, and operated correctly or that a natural disaster, such as the earthquake and tsunami with 30-foot waves that hit the </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/fukushima-nuclear-accident-and-its-implications-nuclear-power-us-and-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> won’t affect it given the increased frequency and intensity of storms  due to climate change. In contrast, wind turbines pose none of these dangers but may pose other potential drawbacks. There also are costs associated with meltdown, mining lung cancer, and waste. Clean, renewables can help reduce such risks. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Cost</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. Nuclear power is among the costliest approaches to solving America’s energy problems. New nuclear power costs about five times more than onshore </span><a href="https://www.oneearth.org/category/wind-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">wind power</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> per kilowatt hour. Per dollar of investment, clean energy solutions – such as energy efficiency and renewable resources – deliver far more energy than nuclear power.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Timing. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Nuclear takes 5-to-17 years longer between planning and operation than renewable energy does.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Emissions</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. Supporters claim these plants can deliver energy with no carbon emissions but there is no such thing as a zero-emission nuclear power plant. </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">Emissions from nuclear plants are on average 23 times the emissions per unit of electricity generated.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Even existing plants emit due to the continuous mining and refining of uranium needed for the plant. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Waste. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">The radioactive waste from nuclear power plants stays radioactive for decades and is typically stored in temporary facilities. But even those storage spaces are running out and the industry is turning to more costly options. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p aria-level="4"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Reducing emissions is critical and that’s why I believe sustainable investors should keep nuclear out of responsible and green investing, and instead support the clean renewable energy sector</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Globally, renewables account for about one third of electricity generation—and </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">renewable capacity will meet 35% of global power generation by 2025, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) .</span></b> <span data-contrast="none">The global energy crisis has triggered unprecedented momentum behind renewables, with the world set to add as much renewable power in the next 5 years as it did in the past 20.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We believe the considerable human and environmental safety issues involved with building and running nuclear plants, as well as the lessons from Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima must not be forgotten.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Why gamble with the environmental and public health risks of it – especially when renewable energy is cleaner and cost competitive. I’m proud that the Green Century Funds have excluded nuclear energy for </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/news/"><span data-contrast="auto">more than two decades</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, offering a true path toward a safer planet, and we have no plans to change our commitment.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
