					<p><strong>Boston, March 28, 2024 – </strong>For the second consecutive year<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-100-most-influential-women-in-u-s-finance-leslie-samuelrich-28260343?mod=B100womenprofile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a><strong><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-100-most-influential-women-in-u-s-finance-leslie-samuelrich-28260343?mod=B100womenprofile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds°</a>, </strong>was named to <strong><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/most-influential-women-in-finance-b881e105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barron’s 100 Most Influential Women in U.S. Finance</a></strong>, joining a corps of noteworthy women in government, technology, banking and financial powerhouses.</p>
<p>Leslie has been a vocal and active leader, promoting environmentally and sustainable investing for the past 10 years at the helm of Green Century. She and others have taken various paths into leadership roles on <a href="https://www.barrons.com/women-in-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barron’s fifth annual list</a>.</p>
<p>From money managers to risk officers, she joins financial leaders at the National Economic Council, U.S. Commerce Department, Nvidia, and other senior leadership positions in the private, nonprofit, and public sectors. Samuelrich is one of a few women honored on the list to work in the responsible investing field. The list of women, all based in the U.S., is <a href="https://www.barrons.com/women-in-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen by a panel of Barron’s writers and editors, and is based on external and internal nominations, according to Barron’s</a>.</p>
<p>“I am truly honored to be chosen again to join these influential and groundbreaking women in finance,” she said. “At Green Century, we help individuals genuinely align their investments with their values by keeping their money out of environmentally harmful industries such as fossil fuels, tobacco, and factory farming. We also flex our power as shareholders and successfully get companies to cut carbon footprints, plastic pollution, and protect nature. We work with about 100 companies each year to bring about change and hold them accountable.”</p>
<p>After majoring in economics at Boston College<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">, Samuelrich gained more than 25 years</a> of experience in corporate engagement and environmental and public health advocacy. Her comments have appeared in The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Reuters, Barron’s, Morningstar, the New York Times, and many other outlets. She was named to InsideClimate News‘  inaugural list of Climate Action 30 in 2022 and completed two terms on the Board of Directors of the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (US SIF).</p>
<p><strong>Samuelrich A Leader in Green Investing</strong></p>
<p>She has attracted attention for her ability to take strong positions and educate the public and financial advisors about greenwashing, ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria, divestment, engagement, and other practices. &#8220;We’re proud of our leadership in fossil fuel free investing, driving a cutting-edge shareholder engagement program, and exposing greenwashing in the field,” she said.</p>
<p>The Green Century Funds have experienced a183 percent growth under her decade-long leadership and her efforts help align people’s investments with their values.</p>
<p>The Green Century Funds are one of the pioneers of fossil fuel free mutual funds with about $1.2 billion in managed assets. Green Century Capital Management is the investment advisor to the Green Century Funds and is owned by nine Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs), nonprofits that advocate for environmental and public health issues. This unique ownership structure means that every dollar Green Century earns managing its Funds can support those nonprofit organizations and their critical work to protect the environment and public health policies.</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there is no regulated term for sustainable investing and may mean and be defined differently from firm to firm, there is growing public and regulatory pressure to provide clear descriptions so that individuals can decide for themselves if the offered investments meet their criteria.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><b><span data-contrast="none">How to Invest Sustainably</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Green Century believes that to </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/sustainable-investment-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">invest sustainably</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">  then you must avoid environmentally dangerous industries. With that step, you don’t invest in industries that you don’t want to support. For example, if you are concerned about climate change, you don’t have to invest your money in the stocks of oil and gas companies. Or if you care about tobacco addiction or  factory farms and animal welfare, you can avoid the companies that make these products or are leaders in these industries. All the Green Century Funds have exclusionary screens to avoid environmentally dangerous companies. The Green Century Balanced Fund also invests in green and sustainable bonds that fund clean energy projects.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sustainable investing helps you align your investments with your values, but does it really help the environment or society? Green Century believes that sustainable investing does make an impact when large groups of people decide to avoid certain industries. This  was the case in battling apartheid in South Africa when individuals and institutions moved their investments out of companies that were doing business in the country.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the last 10 years, the fossil fuel divestment movement has helped shape the sustainable investing field and inspired individuals to divest from fossil fuels and influence their institutions – from Harvard University to the New York Pension Fund – to move their money. So far, nearly 1,500 organizations with assets of more than $39.2 trillion have committed to divest from fossil fuels.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This sustainable investing movement has helped the environment by getting investors to question the long-term viability of the fossil fuel industry once they understand the industry’s plans. The concomitant media attention also helped raise awareness for investors and the public. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><b><span data-contrast="none">Invest Sustainably with Green Century Funds</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Green Century Funds have been helping people invest sustainably since 1991. The Green Century Funds are one of the first families of environmentally responsible fossil fuel free mutual funds and has been a champion of the divest-invest movement since the beginning. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there is no one way for how to invest sustainably, there are many options. If you are looking to invest in mutual funds for yourself or a family member, we encourage you to go beyond the marketing taglines and names of funds and see how each one defines its approach.

					<description><![CDATA[Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green Century Funds° helps investors make an impact for the planet through a sustainable investing strategy, partners with its investment advisor in an award-winning shareholder advocacy program, and a unique ownership model that sends 100% of our net profits to support the environmental campaign work of our nonprofit owners.</p>
<p>One question we often get is, “How do you decide what issues to work on”?</p>
<p>This is an excellent question. There’s no shortage of issues facing our environment, and it can be hard to decide where to start making a difference. The good news is that while our planet may have more problems than it deserves, we’re finding more solutions every day to help fix them.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17905" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="177" /></p>
<p>Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. Shareholder advocacy is a tool used by investors to push a company to report on or change a policy. Green Century negotiates with companies to improve their sustainability practices by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, protecting ocean wildlife from plastic pollution, adopting sustainable agriculture policies and more. Then, once companies make commitments, we assess their progress and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>To choose our priority issues, we evaluate a number of factors. First, we’re Green Century Funds for a reason – we’re all about protecting the environment. So, our first consideration is, how can we make the biggest impact for the planet? These issues run the gamut from stopping global warming, protecting endangered species, preserving forests or reducing plastic waste. We evaluate today’s most pressing issues which, if we can win concrete changes to corporate policy, will produce the most profound benefits for ecosystems around the world?</p>
<p>Then, we think about our comparative advantage. Where can we uniquely advance change? Where does our expertise lie? What emerging frameworks and targets can companies implement to mitigate environmental risks? On which issues can we make the strongest business case for action?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19274 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/raze-solar-pIcseKMisrs-unsplash-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p>At the end of the day, there’s no one issue that merits all of our attention; the threats facing our planet are multifaceted and ever evolving. But one thing we do know is that to ensure we have a planet to operate businesses on in the future, companies need to figure out now how to give back more than they take. And since nature is everybody&#8217;s business, there&#8217;s no company that can stand on the sidelines.</p>
<p>This coming shareholder season, which runs on a schedule similar to a school year, we’re focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting forests around the world by convincing food and consumer goods companies to protect biodiversity by addressing their nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, as well as by establishing science-based targets for nature that will protect our planet for generations to come.</li>
<li>Reducing plastic pollution by pressing companies to use less plastic in their packaging, especially new plastic, and to scale up reuse models that will help drive a circular economy.</li>
<li>Asking companies that have set goals to reduce their contribution to climate change to develop climate transition plans that chart how the company will hit their targets and move toward a clean energy economy.</li>
<li>Expanding the number of companies with Right to Repair policies that help consumers and reduce dangerous electronic waste.</li>
<li>Pressing insurance companies – which, ironically, are pulling coverage from areas prone to natural disasters exacerbated by extreme weather – to stop underwriting the new fossil fuel projects driving extreme weather in the first place.</li>
<li>Protecting animal welfare by asking companies to institute more humane policies such as eliminating gestation crates.</li>
<li>Pushing major retailers to phase out gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric lawn equipment to improve air quality and cut off another key contributor to climate change.<br />
A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19277 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/appolinary-kalashnikova-WYGhTLym344-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>These are just some of the solutions we’ll be advancing this coming year to help build a cleaner, greener future today and for future generations. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.</p>
<p>Thank you for your investment in Green Century Funds, which makes our shareholder advocacy work possible.</p>
