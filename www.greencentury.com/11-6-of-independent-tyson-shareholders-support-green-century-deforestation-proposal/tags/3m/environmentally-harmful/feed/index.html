					<description><![CDATA[Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green Century Funds° helps investors make an impact for the planet through a sustainable investing strategy, partners with its investment advisor in an award-winning shareholder advocacy program, and a unique ownership model that sends 100% of our net profits to support the environmental campaign work of our nonprofit owners.</p>
<p>One question we often get is, “How do you decide what issues to work on”?</p>
<p>This is an excellent question. There’s no shortage of issues facing our environment, and it can be hard to decide where to start making a difference. The good news is that while our planet may have more problems than it deserves, we’re finding more solutions every day to help fix them.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17905" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="177" /></p>
<p>Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. Shareholder advocacy is a tool used by investors to push a company to report on or change a policy. Green Century negotiates with companies to improve their sustainability practices by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, protecting ocean wildlife from plastic pollution, adopting sustainable agriculture policies and more. Then, once companies make commitments, we assess their progress and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>To choose our priority issues, we evaluate a number of factors. First, we’re Green Century Funds for a reason – we’re all about protecting the environment. So, our first consideration is, how can we make the biggest impact for the planet? These issues run the gamut from stopping global warming, protecting endangered species, preserving forests or reducing plastic waste. We evaluate today’s most pressing issues which, if we can win concrete changes to corporate policy, will produce the most profound benefits for ecosystems around the world?</p>
<p>Then, we think about our comparative advantage. Where can we uniquely advance change? Where does our expertise lie? What emerging frameworks and targets can companies implement to mitigate environmental risks? On which issues can we make the strongest business case for action?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19274 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/raze-solar-pIcseKMisrs-unsplash-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p>At the end of the day, there’s no one issue that merits all of our attention; the threats facing our planet are multifaceted and ever evolving. But one thing we do know is that to ensure we have a planet to operate businesses on in the future, companies need to figure out now how to give back more than they take. And since nature is everybody&#8217;s business, there&#8217;s no company that can stand on the sidelines.</p>
<p>This coming shareholder season, which runs on a schedule similar to a school year, we’re focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting forests around the world by convincing food and consumer goods companies to protect biodiversity by addressing their nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, as well as by establishing science-based targets for nature that will protect our planet for generations to come.</li>
<li>Reducing plastic pollution by pressing companies to use less plastic in their packaging, especially new plastic, and to scale up reuse models that will help drive a circular economy.</li>
<li>Asking companies that have set goals to reduce their contribution to climate change to develop climate transition plans that chart how the company will hit their targets and move toward a clean energy economy.</li>
<li>Expanding the number of companies with Right to Repair policies that help consumers and reduce dangerous electronic waste.</li>
<li>Pressing insurance companies – which, ironically, are pulling coverage from areas prone to natural disasters exacerbated by extreme weather – to stop underwriting the new fossil fuel projects driving extreme weather in the first place.</li>
<li>Protecting animal welfare by asking companies to institute more humane policies such as eliminating gestation crates.</li>
<li>Pushing major retailers to phase out gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric lawn equipment to improve air quality and cut off another key contributor to climate change.<br />
A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just some of the solutions we’ll be advancing this coming year to help build a cleaner, greener future today and for future generations. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many investors – and especially Green Century Funds° investors – can imagine a safer, healthier fossil fuel-free future. That’s why Green Century’s advocates work to convince companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect forests, source renewable energy and more. But as wildfires, floods and extreme temperatures have become more common and climate risk has grown for businesses, we’ve focused on another key driver of the climate crisis: the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Oil and gas corporations need insurance to move forward with fossil fuel exploration and extraction. By refusing to cover these environmentally harmful projects, insurance companies could play a positive role in addressing climate change and avoid significant climate risk: global insured losses from natural disasters last year were estimated at $132 billion, making 2022 the fifth costliest year for insurers on record.</p>
<figure id="attachment_17513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17513" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17513" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230524_121438-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17513" class="wp-caption-text">Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger poses outside Travelers’ annual meeting before presenting Green Century Funds’ proposal to phase out coverage of new fossil fuel projects.</figcaption></figure>
<p>While some European companies have stated they will no longer insure certain types of new oil and gas projects, the U.S. insurance industry has made no such moves. In fact, as U.S. insurers continue to cover major drivers of the climate crisis, they’re sticking customers with the costly consequences: State Farm,* the largest homeowner insurance company in California, announced last month that it would stop selling coverage to homeowners – not just in wildfire zones, but everywhere in the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convince U.S. insurers to keep up with evolving global standards and avoid future losses associated with a warming planet, Green Century led a shareholder advocacy program this year with three of the world’s largest insurers: Chubb*, The Hartford*, and Travelers,* asking each company to phase out the underwriting of new fossil fuel projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our dialogues with each company were informative, but none agreed to phase out new fossil fuel projects. The Green Century Funds filed shareholder resolutions with the companies so that shareholders could weigh in on whether insurers should continue to underwrite some of the activities most directly responsible for warming our planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no climate-related proposals at insurance companies won majority support this shareholder season, Green Century helped the issue gain widespread </span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/fossil-fuel-insurance-is-turning-into-a-climate-change-fight-whats-at-stake-a3e09ce5" data-wplink-edit="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increased board-level discussion, and heightened investor awareness. Going forward, we’ll build on our momentum to drive forwa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd this long-term program to build a green, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuel-free future for our children and grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way you can make an impact is to sign </span><a href="https://pirg.org/take-action/tell-insurance-ceos-stop-insuring-climate-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from our nonprofit owners at PIRG urging these three companies to stop insuring climate risks. Fossil fuels won’t go the way of the dinosaur overnight, but sustained pressure from investors, advocates, and everyday people can and will continue to win meaningful policy change in the years to come.</span></p>
