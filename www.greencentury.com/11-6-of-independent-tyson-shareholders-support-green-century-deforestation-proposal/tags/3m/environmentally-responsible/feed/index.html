										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>From protecting forests to diverting plastic bottles from landfills for use in products, Williams-Sonoma Inc. is one of the many sustainable holdings in the Green Century Equity Fund.<br><br>The high-end home furnishings store, founded in 1973, made its first CDP climate disclosure about five years ago in an effort cut waste, source responsibly and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>Many of the company’s brands are well recognized names, including Williams-Sonoma Home, Pottery Barn, West Elm and more, and the company has operations around the globe. Chuck Williams launched the first store in 1956 after converting space formerly used as a small hardware store in Sonoma, Calif. Ten years ago, the landmark store was reopened in its original location.</p>



<p>The company has set science-based targets to cut emissions across its value chain by 2030 and aims to have all operations carbon neutral by year’s end.<br><br>Williams-Sonoma is working across its myriads of brands to operate in a more environmentally responsible manner. This includes cutting its carbon footprint, incorporating recycled plastics in fibers used for products, and responsibly sourcing wood and cotton for many products.<br><br>For example, the organic cotton in its sheets, rugs and other products is grown without harmful chemicals and pesticides, which helps contribute to cleaner soil and waterways. Wood for furniture and household items are sourced from FSC sources, or those approved by the <a href="https://fsc.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest Stewardship Council.</a><br><br>The company works with a sustainable textile manufacturer, <a href="https://unifi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unifi</a>, that diverts plastic bottles to make high-quality, recycled fibers that are used in Williams Sonoma’s pillows, bedding, furniture and other products. These fibers, Williams-Sonoma says, also release fewer greenhouse gas emissions, offset the use of new petroleum, and conserve water and energy.<br><br>So far, the company has diverted 93 million plastic bottles to date. Further, Unifi named Williams-Sonoma a Champion of Sustainability.<br><br><em>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em><br><br>Williams-Sonoma is one of the companies in <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/equity-fund/">Green Century’s Equity Fund</a> and is working to improve its environmental impact.</p>

					<p>(Boston, MA) &#8211; In a positive development for the Right to Repair movement, technology giant <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a>* announced it would expand its Self Service Repair program to its newest iPhone 14 and M2 Mac models. The company’s continued commitment is a win for consumer rights and efforts to combat e-waste and came after <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century Funds</a>°, a leading environmentally responsible family of mutual funds, advocated for increasing sustainable business practices at the company.</p>
<p>Green Century initiated discussions with Apple in 2021 and submitted a shareholder proposal later that year asking the company to consider the environmental and social benefits of making its devices more easily repairable by consumers and independent repair shops.</p>
<h2><strong>Green Century Advocacy Creates Long-Term Impact for the Environment </strong></h2>
<p>Through a series of collaborative meetings, Green Century provided Apple with compelling evidence on the positive environmental implications of allowing customers to repair instead of replacing their products. Repairs extend the life of products, help reduce electronic and plastic waste, promote a more circular economy, and aligns Apple’s policy on the issue with its own sustainability goals and commitments.</p>
<p>Green Century’s efforts helped to culminate in Apple announcing for the first time in 2021 that it would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products. Green Century withdrew its shareholder proposal in return for Apple’s commitments.</p>
<p>“True to its slogan, Apple is “Thinking Different” by helping to reduce electronic waste and helping customers hold on to their products longer. Green Century is proud to have played a role in Apple&#8217;s evolving support for Right to Repair and hope that their leadership moves its competitors to follow suit,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</p>
<p>Apple and other technology companies traditionally have lobbied against Right to Repair legislation, so the announcement of its expanded repair commitments carries substantial weight in industry discussions. Americans spend around <a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,700</a> per household a year purchasing new electronic devices, and nearly<a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 7 million tons</a> of American <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/what-is-e-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic e-waste</a> end up in landfills each year.</p>
