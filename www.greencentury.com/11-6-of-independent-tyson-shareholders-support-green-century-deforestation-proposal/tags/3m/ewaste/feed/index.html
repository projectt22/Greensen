					<p><strong>(Boston) </strong>Microsoft Corporation* <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be offering extended security updates (ESU) for Microsoft Education customers at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century°</a>, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/microsoft-extends-security-support-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">pushed</a> Microsoft to announce affordable ESU for Windows 10 computers. This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest jump in junked computers ever</a>.</p>
<p>“This allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong>, President of <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century Funds</a>. “It is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.”</p>
<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/10/windows_11_adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">330-400 million devices</a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000 petition signatures</a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.</p>
<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.</p>
<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>
<p>“Getting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate. “We encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.”</p>

					<p>(Boston, MA) &#8211; In a positive development for the Right to Repair movement, technology giant <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a>* announced it would expand its Self Service Repair program to its newest iPhone 14 and M2 Mac models. The company’s continued commitment is a win for consumer rights and efforts to combat e-waste and came after <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century Funds</a>°, a leading environmentally responsible family of mutual funds, advocated for increasing sustainable business practices at the company.</p>
<p>Green Century initiated discussions with Apple in 2021 and submitted a shareholder proposal later that year asking the company to consider the environmental and social benefits of making its devices more easily repairable by consumers and independent repair shops.</p>
<h2><strong>Green Century Advocacy Creates Long-Term Impact for the Environment </strong></h2>
<p>Through a series of collaborative meetings, Green Century provided Apple with compelling evidence on the positive environmental implications of allowing customers to repair instead of replacing their products. Repairs extend the life of products, help reduce electronic and plastic waste, promote a more circular economy, and aligns Apple’s policy on the issue with its own sustainability goals and commitments.</p>
<p>Green Century’s efforts helped to culminate in Apple announcing for the first time in 2021 that it would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products. Green Century withdrew its shareholder proposal in return for Apple’s commitments.</p>
<p>“True to its slogan, Apple is “Thinking Different” by helping to reduce electronic waste and helping customers hold on to their products longer. Green Century is proud to have played a role in Apple&#8217;s evolving support for Right to Repair and hope that their leadership moves its competitors to follow suit,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</p>
<p>Apple and other technology companies traditionally have lobbied against Right to Repair legislation, so the announcement of its expanded repair commitments carries substantial weight in industry discussions. Americans spend around <a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,700</a> per household a year purchasing new electronic devices, and nearly<a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 7 million tons</a> of American <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/what-is-e-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic e-waste</a> end up in landfills each year.</p>
