					<p><strong>(Boston) </strong>Microsoft Corporation* <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be offering extended security updates (ESU) for Microsoft Education customers at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century°</a>, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/microsoft-extends-security-support-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">pushed</a> Microsoft to announce affordable ESU for Windows 10 computers. This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest jump in junked computers ever</a>.</p>
<p>“This allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong>, President of <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century Funds</a>. “It is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.”</p>
<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/10/windows_11_adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">330-400 million devices</a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000 petition signatures</a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.</p>
<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.</p>
<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>
<p>“Getting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate. “We encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.”</p>
