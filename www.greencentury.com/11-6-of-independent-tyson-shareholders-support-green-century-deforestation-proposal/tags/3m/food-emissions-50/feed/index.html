<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong> Thomas Peterson, Shareholder Advocate, tpeterson@greencentury.com, 781-349-2615; Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, markm@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</p>



<p><strong>Boston, May 20, 2022 – </strong>At US Foods’ annual meeting on Wednesday, 88.5% of voting shareholders approved a Green Century° <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1491252/000121465922005433/p419220px14a6g.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shareholder proposal</a> asking the company to set science-based targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; The proposal offered an opportunity for shareholders to recommend that US Foods set ambitious emissions reduction targets to achieve “net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.”</p>



<p>The US Foods Board of Directors stated an intention to <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/603501095/files/doc_financials/2021/ar/US-Foods_Proxy_WEB.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“</a><a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/603501095/files/doc_financials/2021/ar/US-Foods_Proxy_WEB.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substantially implement</a><a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/603501095/files/doc_financials/2021/ar/US-Foods_Proxy_WEB.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">”</a> Green Century’s proposal and did not make a recommendation on whether shareholders support or oppose the proposal.</p>



<p>US Foods, the nation’s second-largest food distributor, supplies <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/603501095/files/doc_financials/2021/ar/US-Foods_Proxy_WEB.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 250,000</a> restaurants, hotels, schools, healthcare facilities and other institutions nationwide. It is critical that food companies act rapidly to reduce their climate impact because greenhouse gas emissions from the food system represent roughly a third of all planet-warming emissions.</p>



<p><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate Thomas Peterson issued the following statement in response to the shareholder vote:</strong></p>



<p>“US Foods shareholders sent a resounding message: The company must accelerate its efforts to limit the climate impact of both its fleets and its supply chains and set ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. As one of the largest American food distributors, US Foods’ emissions reduction efforts can catalyze change in the food industry.</p>



<p>“US Foods traces its origins back to the 19th century, but it has never faced a situation quite like this. Climate change will have unprecedented consequences for agricultural supply chains for decades to come, and companies need to adapt to mitigate these impacts and maintain competitiveness. US Foods must therefore implement strategies to limit the emissions generated by the production of the food it distributes, while also reducing the planet-warming pollution from its fleet of roughly 6,500 trucks.</p>



<p>“This strikingly high majority vote from US Foods shareholders follows a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/costco-shareholder-vote-signals-focus-on-supply-chain-emissions-11643194803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landmark 70% vote from Costco* shareholders</a> in favor of a similar Green Century proposal in January, and underscores that investors expect food companies to act rapidly to reduce their climate impact.”</p>

<p><strong>Media Contact:</strong> Thomas Peterson, tpeterson@greencentury.com, 781-349-2615<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Boston, May 12, 2022 – </strong>In response to a Green Century° shareholder proposal, the grocery retailer Kroger* has committed to setting science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its full value chain, including its operations and its supply chains. Greenhouse gas emissions from the food system represent roughly a third of all planet-warming emissions. Kroger is the largest supermarket chain in the United States, and among the nation’s largest general retailers.</p>



<p>“From clearing rainforests for agriculture, to raising livestock, to transporting food from farms on one continent to stores on another, our food system generates significant planet-warming emissions,” said Green Century president Leslie Samuelrich. “But it doesn’t have to be that way. If other large food retailers follow Kroger’s lead in reducing their supply chain emissions, it could galvanize a shift toward sustainable agriculture.”</p>



<p>Green Century’s shareholder proposal to Kroger called on the grocery chain to set science-based emissions reduction targets for its scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions that would lead to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those from a company’s operations and purchased energy, while the emissions from its supply chains and the use of its products are known as scope 3.</p>



<p>A similar Green Century proposal earned a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/costco-shareholder-vote-signals-focus-on-supply-chain-emissions-11643194803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landmark <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/majority-of-costco-shareholders-support-landmark-green-century-proposal-on-climate-change/">70% shareholder vote</a></a> at competitor Costco’s* annual meeting in January. Rather than facing a shareholder vote, Kroger agreed to Green Century’s request, prompting the withdrawal of the shareholder proposal.</p>



<p>“It’s great to see Kroger step up to the plate and commit to disclosing its full climate impact and set high-ambition targets to reduce its emissions. If we are to decarbonize the food system, other retailers will need to do the same,” said Green Century shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson.</p>



<p>Kroger has committed to setting targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). That will require Kroger, in 2023, to improve its existing scope 1 and 2 emissions targets enough that it plays its part in keeping the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5°C from pre-industrial levels. Kroger will also set a scope 3 target for the first time and disclose its comprehensive scope 3 emissions, which likely represent the vast majority of its climate impact. For context, Walmart* has estimated that for retailers, <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/esgreport/esg-issues/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly 95% of emissions are in scope 3</a>.</p>



<p>Also, Kroger now will disclose and set a target to reduce emissions related to agriculture, land-use change, and deforestation in its supply chains. Kroger, like other retailers, had been a laggard in reporting on these emissions, as highlighted by sustainability non-profit Ceres’ Food Emissions 50 benchmark.</p>



<p>“Ceres is encouraged by these new commitments from Kroger, as they position Kroger to be one of the first food-retail companies to commit to science-based climate action across its full value chain,” said Julie Nash, Senior Program Director for Food &amp; Forests at Ceres. “Kroger stands out among the target ​food-retail companies in Food Emissions 50, an investor initiative designed to reduce emissions in the food sector, by ​being the first to commit to including forests, land use, and agriculture in its climate targets ​and its scope 3 emissions disclosure – which is one of the major engagement priorities of the initiative.”</p>



<p>Green Century was among the first investor signatories to the Food Emissions 50 initiative.</p>
