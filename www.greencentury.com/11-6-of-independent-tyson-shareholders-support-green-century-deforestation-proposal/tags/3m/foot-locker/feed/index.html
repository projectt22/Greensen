<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 – </strong>5.7% of shareholder votes were cast in favor of a shareholder proposal asking Foot Locker* to set climate emissions reduction targets at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. Green Century° and <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a><em> </em>filed the proposal.  </p>



<p>“Without climate targets, investors are in the dark about Foot Locker’s plans to mitigate climate risk,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Setting a goal to cut planet-warming emissions shows that Foot Locker is working to reduce its climate impact, not just measure it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/f4606fc1-6d5b-46c9-b175-2cd50429c30e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker committed</a> to setting climate emissions reduction targets and a net-zero goal in response to an <em>As You Sow </em>shareholder proposal. The company quietly retracted its commitment this year in its <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact report</a> and has not shared plans to adopt new climate targets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Climate change threatens footwear and apparel companies&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Footwear and apparel companies are expected to experience significant impacts as climate change intensifies. Asia is the “<a href="https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/asia-still-garment-factory-world-yet-faces-numerous-challenges-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garment factory of the world</a>,” according to the International Labor Organization, as well as the world’s <a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-asia-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most disaster-prone region</a>. Climate disasters could <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-state-of-fashion-2024-report-climate-crisis-supply-chain-sustainability-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten $65 billion worth of apparel exports</a> from countries critical to footwear and apparel production by 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/node/21641/html#item1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s disclosures</a> warn that climate-related hazards could disrupt production and delivery. The vast majority of <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s suppliers</a> for its brand-named products, totaling 90 percent, are sourced from climate-vulnerable countries in Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Foot Locker out of step with industry</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six hundred and forty footwear and apparel retailers, such as <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/impact/initiatives/reducing-our-carbon-footprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nike*,</a> <a href="https://sustainability.decathlon.com/what-action-plan-is-needed-to-reduce-absolute-co2-eq-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decathalon</a> and <a href="https://www.jdplc.com/esg/environment/climate-change/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JD Sports</a>, have set or committed to setting science-based targets to reduce their climate emissions and associated risks. <a href="https://earth.org/what-is-the-united-nations-fashion-industry-charter-for-climate-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nearly 130 apparel companies</a> have signed on to the <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/sectoral-engagement-for-climate-action/fashion-charter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Nation’s Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,</a> which requires adopting science-based targets and collaborating on plans to reach them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Foot Locker’s prior pledge recognized the role it can play in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change on its business and the Earth,” <strong>said Danielle Fugere, president and chief counsel of <em>As You Sow</em></strong>. “Recommitting to greenhouse gas reduction targets would allow Foot Locker to address the growing impacts of climate change and better compete with its peers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As climate emissions increase, so does economic risk, &#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“Investors want Foot Locker to lace up its shoes and catch up to the industry in reducing its carbon footprint.”&nbsp;</p>
