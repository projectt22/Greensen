<p><strong>Boston, June 26, 2025</strong> – Conagra Brands*, the parent company of Orville Redenbacher’s, Duncan Hines, Slim Jim and other well-known food brands will assess whether it should replicate the nature and biodiversity protections it employs in forests in non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco in Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.</p>



<p>“Food companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It’s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.”</p>



<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat</strong></p>



<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina. The Cerrado alone, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% of all species</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on Earth, has lost </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million acres of natural savanna</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in recent decades</a>. This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.</p>



<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection</strong></p>



<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company’s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;It’s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.”</p>

<p>A shareholder proposal co-filed by Green Century Capital Management called on Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, to conduct a full assessment of its impact on nature and on the risks the company faces from the increasing instability of the natural environment. Company shareholders voted on the proposal at the company’s annual meeting Thursday. The proposal received 17% of votes cast, more than a similar proposal received at the company’s 2024 stockholder meeting.</p>



<p>“Home Depot sells lumber, paints, and herbicides, all of which adversely impact the environment, during either production or use,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company has a responsibility to shareholders and the planet to account for how its business affects nature.”</p>



<p><strong>Investors concerned about the health of the natural world</strong></p>



<p>Climate change, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are stressing the planet. In this context, investors have begun asking companies to fully disclose how their operations, sourcing and sales impact the environment. More than 350 companies have committed to providing a comprehensive accounting of these actions under the <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure</a>.  The proposal co-filed by Green Century asks Home Depot to provide a similar assessment. The initiative was led by Domini Impact Investments and was also supported by Proxy Impact on behalf of the Great Oaks Fund.</p>



<p>University of British Columbia Prof <a href="https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/suzanne-simard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanne Simard</a>, author of <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest</em>, presented the proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. In her remarks, Simard, a professor of forest ecology, described the important role of forests in mitigating climate change and how industrial logging degrades the health of forests. Home Depot sources approximately 17% of its lumber <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the pristine Canadian boreal</a> forests. Studies have documented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe long-term damage</a> from forestry practices in the boreal and how the increasing rate and severity of wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/12/climate/canada-wildfires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hampered the forest’s ability to recover and regrow</a>.</p>



<p>“Home Depot needs to do a better job of taking care of the home we all share: Earth,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“No one’s going to build a new deck when a wildfire’s burning in the back yard.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2025</strong> – J.M. Smucker*, parent company of Folgers, Café Bustelo and Dunkin’ at Home coffee products, has agreed to review its forest protection policies with an ambition of eventually sourcing all of its ingredients without any collateral deforestation. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century Capital Management.</p>



<p>“As investors, we encourage companies to reduce their material risks and improve their environmental impact,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Smuckers’ will follow up its research swiftly with a commitment to source coffee and other ingredients from verified deforestation-free sources.”</p>



<p>J.M. Smucker is the largest seller of at-home coffee in the <a href="https://www.jmsmucker.com/brands-you-love/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a>. It also produces its namesake jellies, Hostess Twinkies, Milk Bone dog biscuits, and a wide range of other popular <a href="https://www.jmsmucker.com/brands-you-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack and pet foods</a>. Coffee and other agricultural products are among the largest drivers of global <a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2022/06/deforestation-in-coffee-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Assessment followed by commitment</strong></p>



<p>As part of its agreement with Green Century, in 2025, J.M. Smucker will assess the steps necessary to ensure the company uses deforestation-free supplies of coffee, palm, soy and cocoa, as well as wood pulp used in packaging. The company plans to follow the assessment with a transition to deforestation-free supplies in 2026, as commercially feasible. Any policy adopted will include ongoing third-party assurance of forest protection practices as well as a grievance system for reporting violations.</p>



<p><strong>Forest protection is climate protection</strong></p>



<p>Deforestation and destruction of other natural habitats is responsible for <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Forests can also play an important role in removing carbon from the atmosphere, <a href="https://www.woodwellclimate.org/global-forest-carbon-storage-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but only if they are allowed to grow and thrive</a>. The <a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatest driver of deforestation globally is agriculture</a>, making it critical for food companies to commit to deforestation-free ingredients. </p>



<p>&#8220;J.M. Smucker has woken up and smelled the coffee,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;American consumers love their morning joe and they also want to protect the environment. These steps will help J.M. Smucker do both things, and provide sustainable coffee, snacks, and pet products.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston, December 17, 2024 – Procter &#38; Gamble, the international consumer goods company, has agreed to provide additional information regarding its practices related to sourcing wood pulp from the boreal [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p><strong>Boston, December 17, 2024 – </strong>Procter &amp; Gamble, the international consumer goods company, has agreed to provide additional information regarding its practices related to sourcing wood pulp from the boreal forests of Canada. The updates will reiterate the company’s aim to eliminate sourcing from intact forest landscapes and to protect primary forests. Among the world’s largest and most important remaining forestlands, the boreal provides critical wildlife habitat and stores vast amounts of carbon. Procter &amp; Gamble uses some wood pulp from the boreal in the production of Charmin toilet paper, Bounty paper towels, and other consumer products.<br></p>



<p>The agreement came after discussions earlier this year with investment firms Green Century Capital Management, AXA Investment Managers, BNP Paribas Asset Management, and Robeco. In exchange, these investors agreed to withdraw a shareholder proposal asking the company to enhance its disclosures in relation to its existing efforts to mitigate risks to biodiversity and forest resilience.<br></p>



<p>“These disclosures will help investors better understand how P&amp;G is managing the risks associated with sourcing from such an ecologically important area,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “We’d prefer that the company eliminate its sourcing from the boreal. But if it is going to continue, it’s important that the company more clearly disclose its policies, practices and impact.”<br></p>



<p>This represents a significant milestone in the ongoing discussions between the investor group and the company, which aim to pursue their dialogue with P&amp;G and closely monitor the company’s efforts with regards to this important biome through enhanced disclosures.<br></p>



<p>In addition, P&amp;G will renew its investment in the development of alternative fibers. The company also agreed to increase disclosure of its advocacy and lobbying efforts related to robust forest management in Canadian forests.<br></p>



<p><strong>Multiple Pressures on the Boreal</strong><br>The boreal is under increasing ecological pressure from the combined effects of climate change and decades of logging. Recent years have seen a drop in caribou populations, considered an indicator of overall biodiversity decline. In 2023, wildfires consumed over 45 million acres of the boreal, roughly equal to the totals from the previous seven years combined.<br></p>



<p>“By relying on an increasingly fragile ecosystem, companies expose themselves to sourcing risks,” said Peter van der Werf, Head of Active Ownership at Robeco. “This is why we encouraged P&amp;G to explore how its vision for fiber resilience could be strengthened in the long run, a logical step for both its competitive standing and biodiversity<br></p>



<p>Adam Kanzer, Head of Stewardship, Americas at BNP Paribas Asset Management, added, “Degradation of the Canadian boreal is a key threat to diversified investors. We cannot afford to lose this critical carbon sink and cradle of biodiversity. These enhanced disclosures should provide investors with a clearer understanding of the role P&amp;G is playing. We hope that this will raise the bar for other companies as well.”</p>

<p><strong>BOSTON, October 16, 2024</strong> – In response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century<em>°</em>, Costco Wholesale Corporation* committed to publishing a comprehensive deforestation assessment and action plan for its Kirkland Signature brand. In exchange, Green Century and co-filer Boston Common Asset Management agreed to withdraw the proposal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nature-related risks have emerged as a high priority issue for investors in the last year and we applaud Costco for strengthening its efforts to protect vital habitats around the world, <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Millions of Costco members will be gratified to know that their favorite Kirkland Signature items may be moving towards protecting rather than harming tropical forests, home to species from jaguars to giant otters.”</p>



<p>Costco says it plans to release its deforestation assessment and action plan by the end of 2025. The disclosure will lay out Costco’s roadmap to protect forests and other natural landscapes from deforestation when sourcing its beef, palm oil, soy and wood products. Those industries combined drive nearly three-quarters of tropical <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/drivers-of-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Costco to consider first-ever ‘no-deforestation’ targets</strong></p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/dining/costco.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly one-third</a> of U.S. consumers shop at Costco, making it the third-largest retailer in the world behind Amazon and Walmart. Kirkland-brand items generated <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-built-56-billion-kirkland-120000770.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADPkNhgRSwQj1r5dDPyAw8P3vBeCsB_YPGKih1keNcrKIBb5hbzW-oByMFBSsRutYAs9SZw6_c7_yFljzYHttINMKR7CpPyozBe04lFUYxpkpSBH8c4ASdbsEhkhHu0vNyimz1CJjpoq2VFIzt7BwZFeuT68TetxpF2VK5i8TF6f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$56 billion</a> in revenue for Costco last fiscal year – more than Nike, Coca-Cola, and United Airlines. The brand’s massive footprint means any incremental commitment to protect the planet has an outsized effect.</p>



<p>Many countries <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/policies-tackling-deforestation-pose-investor-risk-report-says-2024-03-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented new policies</a> last year to preserve forests, promote biodiversity and help the climate. While Costco did not commit to fully eliminating deforestation from its Kirkland Signature brand supply chains, the wholesaler stated that it will consider adopting time-bound deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) commitments for beef, soy, palm oil and/or wood products in its forthcoming deforestation action plan.</p>



<p>“Costco knows it shouldn’t destroy tropical forests to stock its shelves,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, Director of Shareholder Advocacy at Green Century</strong>. “We appreciate this step and encourage the company to further protect global forests by setting time-bound no-deforestation targets across its supply chain.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 9, 2023 </strong>– Archer-Daniels-Midland Company* (ADM), one of the <a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/top-lists/top-10-companies-from-agriculture-industry-in-US-by-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest agricultural companies in the world</a>, has agreed to take important steps to help protect South American ecosystems critical to the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century Funds<em>°</em>, Robeco, and BNP Paribas Asset Management, ADM agreed to conduct a feasibility study in 2023 to determine when it can eliminate “native vegetation conversion” from its soy and corn supply chains in South America and issue a correlated commitment. In exchange, investors withdrew the proposal. Native vegetation conversion, or repurposing wild land for agriculture and other uses, <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/soy-made-the-cerrado-a-breadbasket-climate-change-may-end-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">degrades ecosystems such as the Cerrado</a> savanna in Brazil that are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.</p>
<p>“Places like the Cerrado may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they’re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, Green Century Funds’ president. “ADM’s commitment is an important step toward getting these critical biomes the safeguards they need.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Food &amp; agriculture contributes one-third of global climate emissions</strong></span></h3>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.adm.com/globalassets/sustainability/sustainability-reports/adm-h2-2021-soy-progress-report-compressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADM reported 97% deforestation- and conversion-free volumes for Brazilian soy</a> and announced at COP27 a commitment to <a href="https://www.tropicalforestalliance.org/assets/Agriculture-Sector-Roadmap-January-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct a global assessment in 2023</a> of the risk of native vegetation conversion to soy production. Green Century’s proposal asked ADM to expand its current plan to include an independently verified commitment to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its global supply chains by 2025.</p>
<p>“The global food and agriculture industry contributes about <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third</a> of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annie Sanders</a>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century Funds. “We look forward to working with ADM to eliminate native vegetation conversion in its supply chains as soon as possible in South America – and beyond.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Soy production is a leading cause of native vegetation conversion in South America</strong></span></h3>
<p>Soy production is a <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/commodities/soy-production-forests-south-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading cause of native vegetation conversion</a> in South American biomes and part of a broader decline of South American wilderness. As the world’s most biodiverse savanna, <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Cerrado houses 5% of the world’s animals and plants</a> including vulnerable species such as jaguars, maned wolves and giant anteaters. The <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/gran-chaco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gran Chaco</a> forest between the Cerrado and the Andes Mountains is the second-largest forest in South America, behind only the Amazon rainforest. Agriculture is projected to supplant millions of additional acres of native vegetation in the Gran Chaco by 2030.</p>
<p>“Forests are not the only landscapes that need protection. The Cerrado, for example, feeds 8 of 12 of Brazil’s major river basins and three aquifers. Native vegetation clearance has already been linked to decreased rainfall,” said Adam Kanzer, head of stewardship, Americas for BNP Paribas Asset Management. “Current policies could lead to very serious near-term consequences for Brazilian agriculture and human health. We commend ADM for agreeing to take a hard look at what it would take to adopt a more holistic approach to its most important South American supply chains.”</p>
<p>“By signing the COP26 Glasgow deforestation pledge, Robeco has committed to work towards eliminating agricultural-driven deforestation from our investment portfolios by 2025. For many years our engagement has focused on forest biomes such as the Amazon and boreal forests. However, with increasing corporate and legislative action on deforestation, pressures on non-forest biomes such as the Cerrado and Gran Chaco are growing.” says Peter van der Werf, Executive Director Active Ownership at Robeco. “By strengthening their approach to wider native vegetation conversion, ADM is protecting its license to operate and moving towards a future proof business model, safeguarding their key productive assets: the land and ecosystem services they depend on.”</p>
