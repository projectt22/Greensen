<p><strong>Boston, June 26, 2025</strong> – Conagra Brands*, the parent company of Orville Redenbacher’s, Duncan Hines, Slim Jim and other well-known food brands will assess whether it should replicate the nature and biodiversity protections it employs in forests in non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco in Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.</p>



<p>“Food companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It’s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.”</p>



<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat</strong></p>



<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina. The Cerrado alone, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% of all species</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on Earth, has lost </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million acres of natural savanna</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in recent decades</a>. This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.</p>



<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection</strong></p>



<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company’s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;It’s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.”</p>

<p>A shareholder proposal co-filed by Green Century Capital Management called on Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, to conduct a full assessment of its impact on nature and on the risks the company faces from the increasing instability of the natural environment. Company shareholders voted on the proposal at the company’s annual meeting Thursday. The proposal received 17% of votes cast, more than a similar proposal received at the company’s 2024 stockholder meeting.</p>



<p>“Home Depot sells lumber, paints, and herbicides, all of which adversely impact the environment, during either production or use,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company has a responsibility to shareholders and the planet to account for how its business affects nature.”</p>



<p><strong>Investors concerned about the health of the natural world</strong></p>



<p>Climate change, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are stressing the planet. In this context, investors have begun asking companies to fully disclose how their operations, sourcing and sales impact the environment. More than 350 companies have committed to providing a comprehensive accounting of these actions under the <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure</a>.  The proposal co-filed by Green Century asks Home Depot to provide a similar assessment. The initiative was led by Domini Impact Investments and was also supported by Proxy Impact on behalf of the Great Oaks Fund.</p>



<p>University of British Columbia Prof <a href="https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/suzanne-simard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanne Simard</a>, author of <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest</em>, presented the proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. In her remarks, Simard, a professor of forest ecology, described the important role of forests in mitigating climate change and how industrial logging degrades the health of forests. Home Depot sources approximately 17% of its lumber <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the pristine Canadian boreal</a> forests. Studies have documented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe long-term damage</a> from forestry practices in the boreal and how the increasing rate and severity of wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/12/climate/canada-wildfires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hampered the forest’s ability to recover and regrow</a>.</p>



<p>“Home Depot needs to do a better job of taking care of the home we all share: Earth,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“No one’s going to build a new deck when a wildfire’s burning in the back yard.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, February 20, 2025</strong> – Bloomin&#8217; Brands, parent company of several of the largest U.S. restaurant chains, has agreed to strengthen its commitment to protect forests when sourcing ingredients for its 1,480 restaurants around the world. The move came after Green Century Capital Management filed a shareholder proposal asking the company to assess its impact on biodiversity and nature loss.</p>



<p>“We congratulate Bloomin&#8217; Brands on strengthening its forest protection policies,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “When you go out for dinner, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry that people are cutting down forests in the Amazon so you can eat your meal.”</p>



<p>Bloomin&#8217; Brands owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and several other casual dining chains. Through direct ownership and franchises it is responsible for <a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/d653a2f0-ac33-4137-80f8-93636fba2f03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,150 restaurants in the United States</a> and smaller numbers in other countries.</p>



<p><strong>Beef and Palm Oil Drive Tropical Deforestation</strong></p>



<p>Beef and palm oil production are among the largest reasons for the loss of rainforests worldwide. In exchange for Green Century withdrawing its shareholder proposal, Bloomin&#8217; Brands agreed to strengthen its policies to protect forests when sourcing these ingredients. For the first time, the company will disclose the percentage of beef sourced from Brazil. In addition, Bloomin’ says it will ensure that 60% of that Brazilian beef will come from verified deforestation-free sources. The company says it aims to increase this commitment to 100% in the future.</p>



<p>Bloomin’ will also improve the traceability of its palm oil products and agreed to include biodiversity impacts in the double-materiality assessment it is undertaking in 2025.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bloomin&#8217; Brands has a significant presence in Brazil, raising the possibility that beef sold in the company’s restaurants contributes to forest loss in the Amazon,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;We appreciate the company&#8217;s willingness to begin tracking and disclosing its beef sourcing specific to Brazil. We hope this will pave the way for a commitment to 100% deforestation-free beef in the near future.&#8221; Green Century has been pressing Bloomin’ Brands to improve its forest protection policies for several years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/notable-43-of-bloomin-brands-shareholders-support-green-century-proposal-to-address-climate-change-and-deforestation/">43% of the company’s shareholders</a> voted in favor of a shareholder proposal by Green Century to address climate change and improve forest protection.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, December 17, 2024 – </strong>Procter &amp; Gamble, the international consumer goods company, has agreed to provide additional information regarding its practices related to sourcing wood pulp from the boreal forests of Canada. The updates will reiterate the company’s aim to eliminate sourcing from intact forest landscapes and to protect primary forests. Among the world’s largest and most important remaining forestlands, the boreal provides critical wildlife habitat and stores vast amounts of carbon. Procter &amp; Gamble uses some wood pulp from the boreal in the production of Charmin toilet paper, Bounty paper towels, and other consumer products.<br></p>



<p>The agreement came after discussions earlier this year with investment firms Green Century Capital Management, AXA Investment Managers, BNP Paribas Asset Management, and Robeco. In exchange, these investors agreed to withdraw a shareholder proposal asking the company to enhance its disclosures in relation to its existing efforts to mitigate risks to biodiversity and forest resilience.<br></p>



<p>“These disclosures will help investors better understand how P&amp;G is managing the risks associated with sourcing from such an ecologically important area,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “We’d prefer that the company eliminate its sourcing from the boreal. But if it is going to continue, it’s important that the company more clearly disclose its policies, practices and impact.”<br></p>



<p>This represents a significant milestone in the ongoing discussions between the investor group and the company, which aim to pursue their dialogue with P&amp;G and closely monitor the company’s efforts with regards to this important biome through enhanced disclosures.<br></p>



<p>In addition, P&amp;G will renew its investment in the development of alternative fibers. The company also agreed to increase disclosure of its advocacy and lobbying efforts related to robust forest management in Canadian forests.<br></p>



<p><strong>Multiple Pressures on the Boreal</strong><br>The boreal is under increasing ecological pressure from the combined effects of climate change and decades of logging. Recent years have seen a drop in caribou populations, considered an indicator of overall biodiversity decline. In 2023, wildfires consumed over 45 million acres of the boreal, roughly equal to the totals from the previous seven years combined.<br></p>



<p>“By relying on an increasingly fragile ecosystem, companies expose themselves to sourcing risks,” said Peter van der Werf, Head of Active Ownership at Robeco. “This is why we encouraged P&amp;G to explore how its vision for fiber resilience could be strengthened in the long run, a logical step for both its competitive standing and biodiversity<br></p>



<p>Adam Kanzer, Head of Stewardship, Americas at BNP Paribas Asset Management, added, “Degradation of the Canadian boreal is a key threat to diversified investors. We cannot afford to lose this critical carbon sink and cradle of biodiversity. These enhanced disclosures should provide investors with a clearer understanding of the role P&amp;G is playing. We hope that this will raise the bar for other companies as well.”</p>

<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>9. Pressing tech companies to curb emissions.</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>While IBM* has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-31-of-ibm-shareholders-support-green-century-climate-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</a></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>7.

In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Chemours &#8211; the DuPont chemical company spinoff &#8211; agreed in 2022 to not buy titanium sourced from mines adjacent to the Okefenokee. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/investors-call-on-chemours-to-stay-out-of-the-okefenokee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century continued to press Chemours in 2024 to make that commitment permanent.</a> </span></span></p>

Other mutual funds in the responsible investing space had followed Green Century’s lead but now are backtracking. You can count on Green Century to remain steadfast in its opposition to coal, oil, gas and other environmentally dangerous industries including nuclear power. </span></p>

<p><strong>BOSTON, October 16, 2024</strong> – In response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century<em>°</em>, Costco Wholesale Corporation* committed to publishing a comprehensive deforestation assessment and action plan for its Kirkland Signature brand. In exchange, Green Century and co-filer Boston Common Asset Management agreed to withdraw the proposal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nature-related risks have emerged as a high priority issue for investors in the last year and we applaud Costco for strengthening its efforts to protect vital habitats around the world, <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Millions of Costco members will be gratified to know that their favorite Kirkland Signature items may be moving towards protecting rather than harming tropical forests, home to species from jaguars to giant otters.”</p>



<p>Costco says it plans to release its deforestation assessment and action plan by the end of 2025. The disclosure will lay out Costco’s roadmap to protect forests and other natural landscapes from deforestation when sourcing its beef, palm oil, soy and wood products. Those industries combined drive nearly three-quarters of tropical <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/drivers-of-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Costco to consider first-ever ‘no-deforestation’ targets</strong></p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/dining/costco.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly one-third</a> of U.S. consumers shop at Costco, making it the third-largest retailer in the world behind Amazon and Walmart. Kirkland-brand items generated <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-built-56-billion-kirkland-120000770.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADPkNhgRSwQj1r5dDPyAw8P3vBeCsB_YPGKih1keNcrKIBb5hbzW-oByMFBSsRutYAs9SZw6_c7_yFljzYHttINMKR7CpPyozBe04lFUYxpkpSBH8c4ASdbsEhkhHu0vNyimz1CJjpoq2VFIzt7BwZFeuT68TetxpF2VK5i8TF6f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$56 billion</a> in revenue for Costco last fiscal year – more than Nike, Coca-Cola, and United Airlines. The brand’s massive footprint means any incremental commitment to protect the planet has an outsized effect.</p>



<p>Many countries <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/policies-tackling-deforestation-pose-investor-risk-report-says-2024-03-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented new policies</a> last year to preserve forests, promote biodiversity and help the climate. While Costco did not commit to fully eliminating deforestation from its Kirkland Signature brand supply chains, the wholesaler stated that it will consider adopting time-bound deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) commitments for beef, soy, palm oil and/or wood products in its forthcoming deforestation action plan.</p>



<p>“Costco knows it shouldn’t destroy tropical forests to stock its shelves,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/annie-sanders/"><strong>Annie Sanders</strong></a><strong>, Director of Shareholder Advocacy at Green Century</strong>. “We appreciate this step and encourage the company to further protect global forests by setting time-bound no-deforestation targets across its supply chain.”</p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2024</strong>  – Ford Motor Company shareholders delivered 6.6<strong>%</strong> of votes cast in support of Green Century’s<em>°</em> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465924040871/tm2318496-d4_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolution</a> asking the company to eliminate materials linked to deforestation in its cars and trucks. The proposal also asked Ford to buy more sustainable steel and aluminum, and pushed for the company to purchase steel and aluminum plants that run off of clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Ford family has significant control over Ford business decisions because it owns a special class of stock that ensures it has  <a href="https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/the-ford-family-a-permanent-mark-in-business-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of the voting power</a>. Votes against the Green Century proposal by Ford family members could have negatively impacted the vote result.</p>
<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raising cattle</a>, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting rubber</a>, and <a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/1827220/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining minerals</a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage in vulnerable areas such as Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. Deforestation is now one of the leading drivers of <a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> and <a href="https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/how-does-deforestation-impact-wildlife-and-biodiversity-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biodiversity loss.</a></p>
<p>Heavy emitting industries such as steel and aluminum also contribute to climate change. Currently, not a single ton of sustainable steel and aluminum is manufactured in the United States. Green Century’s proposal asks Ford to join organizations like <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a> and the <a href="https://aluminium-stewardship.org/drive-change/sustainability-priorities/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aluminum Stewardship Initiative</a>, which  develop sustainability certifications for aluminum and steel manufacturers and push them to replace fossil fuels with renewables.</p>
<p>“While we had wished for a higher vote, we’re pleased with the support we received,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Enhancing supply chain sustainably at Ford is a new initiative for us, and we plan to keep pressure on the company to address its material environmental risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Supply Chains Are Key</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, Ford set a target to purchase sustainable steel and aluminum for <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/11/09/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of its total steel and aluminum purchases by 2030</a>. The company also planned to <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/04/ford-updates-timing-for-next-gen-evs--readies-manufacturing-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add EVs to its fleet</a>, which are manufactured with more aluminum than gas-powered cars to offset the extra battery weight. The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative works to ensure that aluminum producers are cutting emissions significantly by 2025. Similarly, ResponsibleSteel has a mission to “&#8230;be a driving force in the socially and environmentally responsible production of net-zero steel, globally.” Ford may benefit by joining both organizations, using its influence as a major consumer of steel and aluminum to press for greener production.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone wants to buy a Ford Explorer or F-150 and learn that the leather, rubber, and minerals in their vehicles contributed to deforestation,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Sustainability needs to be woven into every aspect of Ford’s supply chain, because Green Century believe it’s good for Ford’s investors, customers, and the company itself.”</p>

<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Choice Hotels International*, one of the world&#8217;s leading lodging franchisors, has agreed to take the first step in addressing plastic pollution by conducting a program measure single-use plastic and develop strategies for single-use plastic reduction after engagement by Green Century°.</p>
<p>Choice Hotels, which has a diverse portfolio of 22 brands including Comfort Inn, Cambria Hotels, and Econo Lodge, will conduct a plastics reduction inventory program in 2024 and use it to set a new goal to reduce single-use plastic next year.</p>
<p>“As investors learn that plastic used for a minute can pollute our environment for hundreds of years, it has become a risk that companies need to manage,” said<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</a>. “We welcome Choice Hotel’s move to set a new plastic reduction goal.”</p>
<h4><strong>Choice Hotels, On of The Leading Lodging Franchisors, Agrees to Single-Use Plastic Study, Reduction</strong></h4>
<p>Choice Hotel’s commitment comes as consumers, investors, and regulators increasingly focus on the negative impacts of single-use plastic on the planet. According to a recent survey, 80% of U.S. respondents from across the political spectrum support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic.</p>
<p>“Delighting guests and reducing single-use plastics are clearly compatible,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</a>. “Customers want hospitality that doesn’t compromise the beauty of the places they might have traveled thousands of miles to visit.”</p>
<h4>It is estimated that two garbage trucks worth of plastic enter the ocean every minute.</h4>
<p>Recycling, long touted as the solution to the plastic waste crisis, has resulted in only 9% of plastic being recycled. Scientists and experts agree that the best way to reduce plastic pollution is to cut the amount of plastic companies are producing, and to replace non-essential single-use plastic with tested alternatives like reuseable containers.</p>
<p>“Choice is taking the first steps in addressing plastic pollution by better understanding how and how much plastic is used for its hotels,” added Guernsey. “The next step is to implement reductions, which will return long term value to consumers, the business, and investors.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Boston, June 28, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kraft Heinz,* one of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> food and beverage companies in the world, announced a first-ever <a href="http://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/esg/pdf/GlobalDeforestationandConversionFreePolicy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Deforestation- and Conversion-Free Policy</a> in response to a Green Century Funds° shareholder proposal asking the company to eliminate deforestation across its supply chains by 2025. In exchange, Green Century withdrew its proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To achieve a climate-neutral world by mid-century, companies must drastically cut their contribution to deforestation, which accounts for 12% of global climate </span><a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We commend Kraft Heinz for acting to protect tropical forests, biodiversity and our climate.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Kraft Heinz’s new no-deforestation policy helps protect tropical forests</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraft Heinz’s new stance on deforestation is an expansion of its 2018 </span><a href="https://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/pdf/Kraft_Heinz_Sustainable_Palm_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Palm Oil policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that established a commitment to sustainable palm oil. Notably, the new policy sets a 2025 deadline for eliminating deforestation from key commodities in Kraft Heinz’s global supply chains, aligning with recent </span><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientific consensus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The policy covers commodities including beef and soy that are linked to deforestation in tropical regions such as the Brazilian Amazon, which is </span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-animals-live-in-the-amazon-and-8-other-amazon-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home to ten percent of all known species</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and among the last refuges for endangered species from jaguars and pink river dolphins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agriculture industry is the world’s largest contributor to deforestation, causing 75 percent of the world’s tropical deforestation, and the beef industry alone is responsible for </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some studies show it will be nearly impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees without ending deforestation in </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/climate-math-what-a-1-point-5-degree-pathway-would-take#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beef, soy, palm oil and wood products drive the majority </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of global deforestation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many of which are key ingredients in the Kraft Heinz products’ we know and love – from Oscar Meyer meats to Kraft Mac n’ Cheese,” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century&#8217;s Director of Shareholder Advocacy. “We applaud the company’s commitment to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains, thereby helping to protect forests and biodiversity around the world.”</span></p>
