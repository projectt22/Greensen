<p><strong>Boston, June 11, 2025 </strong>– Columbia Sportswear’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century<em>° </em>shareholder proposal requesting that the company set climate emissions reduction targets. The proposal received 7.9% of votes cast.</p>



<p>“Columbia would better serve its investors and bottom line by cutting its climate impact, like so many of its peers have done,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Climate action is a priority for many of Columbia’s outdoorsy customers, so it should be a priority for Columbia.”</p>



<p><a></a>In 2020, the owner of several active lifestyle brands <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/309/columbia-sportswear-company-releases-2020-corporate?ef_id=2efa76054317110b878d1542bfa78f26%3AG%3As" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to cut the climate footprint</a> of its manufacturing by 30%, but the company quietly stopped reporting on its commitment in 2022. Columbia has not indicated that it will adopt a new goal to keep up with the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">649 </a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footwear and apparel companies</a> that have agreed to or already set science-based emissions reduction targets as of May 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Columbia falls behind its mission and peers</strong></p>



<p><a></a>Without action, the footwear and apparel industry by 2050 could account for <a href="https://content.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/m/7f818b40f06e1afd/original/Summary-of-findings-A-New-Textiles-Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a quarter</a> of the global climate emissions necessary to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/2024-was-warmest-year-modern-record-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 was the warmest year</a> on record and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/when-risks-become-reality-extreme-weather-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists say</a> climate change added 41 days of dangerous heat and worsened the severity of flooding.</p>



<p>Consumer concern about climate change is rising with the temperature. A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PricewaterhouseCoopers survey</a> found that more than 80% of consumers say they are willing to pay more for sustainably produced goods, and some would be willing to pay 9.7% more for goods that meet environmental standards. Nine out of ten Gen Zers born between 1996 and 2010 believe that companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-gen-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey study</a>.</p>



<p>Columbia’s mission is to “unlock the outdoors for everyone.” Nevertheless, while Columbia stays silent on climate commitments, its competitors &#8212; including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia,</a> <a href="https://www.vfc.com/responsibility/planet/climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VF Corp</a>*, and <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/meet-brooks/running-responsibly/climate-action/?srsltid=AfmBOoqMK8jgLJzsGhpwmQ2R1kjF11jnwNMHvdGvMjxHHUFWqxm91UWJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooks</a> &#8212; have set climate emissions reduction goals that demonstrate they are working to protect the environment their customers value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Columbia <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/372/columbia-sportswear-company-reports-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=our%20conference%20call.-,ACCELERATE%20Growth%20Strategy,as%20enhanced%20ways%20of%20working." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to attract</a> young, active consumers, yet it has backtracked on its ambition to protect the very outdoors they want to experience,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The company could boost its reputation and competitive edge if it took further steps to protect Earth, not just use it in its advertising.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 14.8% of votes cast on Wednesday supported a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the insurer Markel Group to disclose the climate emissions from its underwriting, investing and insuring activities. The Virginia-based company has grown from <a href="https://www.mklgroup.com/who-we-are/our-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering small buses</a> to insuring a range of properties from boats to <a href="https://www.markel.com/international/london/energy/downstream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oil refineries</a> over its 95 years of operation.  </p>



<p>“Insurers’ pursuit of short-term profits from fossil fuels guarantees long-term environmental and financial costs,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.&nbsp;</strong> “It makes no sense for any business to willingly and knowingly contribute to something &#8212; in this case, climate change &#8212; that causes such large payouts. Investors deserve to know how Markel’s emissions drive the climate risks its business is losing money from.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/is-climate-change-increasing-the-risk-of-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural disasters increase</a> in frequency and severity due to climate change, so do the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulties insurers face in pricing risk</a> and recovering losses from climate disasters. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2023 <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded $100 billion</a> for the fourth consecutive year and the Swiss Re Group projects they could <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double within the next ten years</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impacts of increasing emissions extend to homeowners as well. Insurers are increasingly abandoning areas vulnerable to climate change-fueled severe weather by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/18/homeowners-insurance-california-florida-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to renew policies</a> at the end of their term. A congressional investigation revealed that climate change has spurred <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiking non-renewal rates</a> by insurers and <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher premiums</a> for customers. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more th</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 counties</a> across the United States, the rate of non-renewal has tripled or more since 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Markel is quiet on climate impact&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a professed <a href="https://www.markel.com/about-us/company-responsibility#5927E3E9394A46A29A73467F1A9B4CA4-tab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to environmental stewardship</a>, Markel does not report any of its climate emissions or publish an annual sustainability report. This places the company far behind competitors including <a href="https://asset.trvstatic.com/download/assets/Travelers_TCFDReport2023.pdf/93114e88b97011efa5e28e42e80f1a8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travelers</a>* and <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIG</a>, both of which disclose their operational emissions and are expanding efforts to measure the emissions associated with their investments. Markel is also out of step with the vast majority of other companies in the Russell 1000 index – which represents the biggest companies in the U.S. – 93% of which published a <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/nc/storage/press-releases/article/ga-institutes-research-shows-2023-sustainability-reporting-at-record-levels-as-us-public-compani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustainability report in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, investors and consumers will foot the bill for Markel’s lack of transparency and failure to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Understanding the scope of Markel’s unwriting, investing and insuring of fossil fuels is the first step in responding to these risks to both pocketbooks and the planet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have had a terrific 2023 and have made great strides in helping protect our planet and in making the world a better place through our robust shareholder advocacy, nonprofit ownership, and environmentally responsible funds. Here are some highlights.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Renewable energy plans for top chipmakers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-18785 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Silicon chips are found everywhere these days &#8212; in computers, cell phones, cars, and other consumer and industrial products. Green Century helped convince five top chipmakers to map out their paths to cut carbon emissions. This industry-wide win included some familiar names &#8212; Intel Corporation*, Texas Instruments*, as well as NVIDIA*, Advanced Micro Devices* and ON Semiconductor*. We’re pleased these companies agreed to specify the actions and milestones they will take to reduce carbon and source more renewable energy for the health of our planet.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Convincing insurers to move away from fossil fuels</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-18786 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this year brought more frequent hurricanes, tornadoes, and intense storms due to climate change. Consequently, several insurance companies have stopped issuing new policies for homeowners in California and Florida because of mounting claims. We think it makes sense for them to stop offering insurance coverage to the very industry that has driven these problems. That’s why Green Century led the second year of our campaign to get insurers to stop underwriting and supporting new oil and gas projects. This year, Chubb*, one of the world’s largest insurance companies, agreed to announce it would immediately stop insuring oil and gas projects in conservation areas. This means that worldwide nature reserves, wilderness areas, and marine protected areas will be better safeguarded.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Deforestation rates hit decades-low in Indonesia</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Did you know that for decades tropical forests were destroyed for the cultivation of palm oil, which is found in products ranging from crackers, cookies, and cosmetics, and that Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil? Burning those forests eliminates habitats for orangutans, Sumatran Elephants and other wildlife while releasing tons of carbon pollution into the air.</p>
<p>So, it’s heartening that deforestation rates have declined steadily each year in Indonesia for the last 10 years. And in 2021, it hit a 22-year low!</p>
<p>For the last 10 years, Green Century has pressed companies to switch to producing, trading, buying, and changing how palm oil is grown in Indonesia to protect the environment and this year, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kraft-heinz-sets-global-policy-to-eliminate-deforestation-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">Green Century convinced Kraft Heinz*</a>, one of the largest food and beverage companies, to adopt the most comprehensive global forest protection policy we have ever seen from a food company.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Met people eager to invest with their values throughout the country </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Green Century traveled to events in every region of the country from Los Angeles to New York City, and wherever we went, we found individuals and financial advisors eager to invest in environmentally responsible ways. From the <em>Land Rally</em> in Oregon to<em> ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) for Impact! </em>in Colorado, we look forward to building on the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/events/">connections and conversations</a> we experienced.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Addressing the plastic pollution crisis</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18787" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture3-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Given the global and growing crisis of plastic pollution, Green Century has redoubled its efforts to encourage companies to recycle, reuse and reduce use of plastics. This year, we engaged companies one-by-one and joined forces with major investors in the <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/plastics-treaty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Global Plastics Treaty</a>, an ambitious global effort to end the age of plastic by 2024 in a legally binding document.</p>
<p>Our latest win involves Costco Wholesale*, one of the largest retailers in the world. Our shareholder advocates convinced Costco to expand its plastics reduction efforts. The company committed to increased plastic footprint disclosures and creating a 5-year plastic action plan. This victory, along with the policies we have secured from 12 other companies including Keurig Dr Pepper*, will help keep plastic out of our oceans and protect wildlife</p>

Together with many allies, they also secured new protections for the Boundary Waters (Minnesota), Bristol Bay (Alaska), Chaco Canyon (New Mexico) and the Grand Canyon region (Arizona). In November, voters approved an Environment Texas-backed $1 billion bond <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/articles/texans-vote-yes-on-1-billion-for-state-parks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to fund the largest expansion of parks in the state history</a>.</p>

<p>Green Century and nonprofit owner, Colorado Public Interest Research Group (CoPIRG) worked together on an effort that led to the Centennial State becoming the first in the nation ensuring farmers can fix their tractors and other equipment.</p>
<p>This victory builds on our earlier engagements with Deere &amp; Company*, the manufacturer of the iconic John Deere tractor and a wide array of other agriculture equipment, to reverse its opposition to the right-to-repair movement. Additionally, Green Century and CoPIRG together called on Google* to extend<a href="https://pirg.org/colorado/articles/when-will-my-chromebook-expire-why-computers-should-be-designed-to-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> software on Chromebooks used by school districts and students across the nation</a>. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/googles-chromebook-extension-is-a-win-in-the-fight-against-e-waste/">Green Century engagement</a> led to the company announcing plans to continue software updates for Chromebooks for up to 10 years starting in 2024. This win means millions of serviceable laptops continued to be used instead of ending up in landfills.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Green Century believes that to </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/sustainable-investment-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">invest sustainably</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">  then you must avoid environmentally dangerous industries. With that step, you don’t invest in industries that you don’t want to support. For example, if you are concerned about climate change, you don’t have to invest your money in the stocks of oil and gas companies. Or if you care about tobacco addiction or  factory farms and animal welfare, you can avoid the companies that make these products or are leaders in these industries. All the Green Century Funds have exclusionary screens to avoid environmentally dangerous companies. The Green Century Balanced Fund also invests in green and sustainable bonds that fund clean energy projects.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sustainable investing helps you align your investments with your values, but does it really help the environment or society? Green Century believes that sustainable investing does make an impact when large groups of people decide to avoid certain industries. This  was the case in battling apartheid in South Africa when individuals and institutions moved their investments out of companies that were doing business in the country.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the last 10 years, the fossil fuel divestment movement has helped shape the sustainable investing field and inspired individuals to divest from fossil fuels and influence their institutions – from Harvard University to the New York Pension Fund – to move their money. So far, nearly 1,500 organizations with assets of more than $39.2 trillion have committed to divest from fossil fuels.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This sustainable investing movement has helped the environment by getting investors to question the long-term viability of the fossil fuel industry once they understand the industry’s plans. The concomitant media attention also helped raise awareness for investors and the public. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Green Century Funds have been helping people invest sustainably since 1991. The Green Century Funds are one of the first families of environmentally responsible fossil fuel free mutual funds and has been a champion of the divest-invest movement since the beginning. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there is no one way for how to invest sustainably, there are many options.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many investors – and especially Green Century Funds° investors – can imagine a safer, healthier fossil fuel-free future. That’s why Green Century’s advocates work to convince companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect forests, source renewable energy and more. But as wildfires, floods and extreme temperatures have become more common and climate risk has grown for businesses, we’ve focused on another key driver of the climate crisis: the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Oil and gas corporations need insurance to move forward with fossil fuel exploration and extraction. By refusing to cover these environmentally harmful projects, insurance companies could play a positive role in addressing climate change and avoid significant climate risk: global insured losses from natural disasters last year were estimated at $132 billion, making 2022 the fifth costliest year for insurers on record.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_17513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17513" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17513" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230524_121438-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17513" class="wp-caption-text">Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger poses outside Travelers’ annual meeting before presenting Green Century Funds’ proposal to phase out coverage of new fossil fuel projects.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>While some European companies have stated they will no longer insure certain types of new oil and gas projects, the U.S. insurance industry has made no such moves. In fact, as U.S. insurers continue to cover major drivers of the climate crisis, they’re sticking customers with the costly consequences: State Farm,* the largest homeowner insurance company in California, announced last month that it would stop selling coverage to homeowners – not just in wildfire zones, but everywhere in the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convince U.S. insurers to keep up with evolving global standards and avoid future losses associated with a warming planet, Green Century led a shareholder advocacy program this year with three of the world’s largest insurers: Chubb*, The Hartford*, and Travelers,* asking each company to phase out the underwriting of new fossil fuel projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our dialogues with each company were informative, but none agreed to phase out new fossil fuel projects. The Green Century Funds filed shareholder resolutions with the companies so that shareholders could weigh in on whether insurers should continue to underwrite some of the activities most directly responsible for warming our planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no climate-related proposals at insurance companies won majority support this shareholder season, Green Century helped the issue gain widespread </span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/fossil-fuel-insurance-is-turning-into-a-climate-change-fight-whats-at-stake-a3e09ce5" data-wplink-edit="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increased board-level discussion, and heightened investor awareness. Going forward, we’ll build on our momentum to drive forwa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd this long-term program to build a green, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuel-free future for our children and grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way you can make an impact is to sign </span><a href="https://pirg.org/take-action/tell-insurance-ceos-stop-insuring-climate-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from our nonprofit owners at PIRG urging these three companies to stop insuring climate risks. Fossil fuels won’t go the way of the dinosaur overnight, but sustained pressure from investors, advocates, and everyday people can and will continue to win meaningful policy change in the years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, thank you for your support of the </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Spring-Shareholder-Advocacy-Highlights-3.31.23.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century shareholder advocacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program through your investments to make our planet a cleaner, greener, healthier place.</span></p>

<p>Boston, November 14, 2022 – In response to a Green Century° shareholder proposal, Costco,* one of the largest retailers in the world, has committed to setting climate emissions reduction targets for its full value chain &#8212; cumulatively called “scope 3” emissions &#8212; in 2023. The commitment comes after 70% of its voting shareholders opted in January 2022 for a Green Century proposal asking Costco to include the emissions from its producers, shippers and other partners when setting targets to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>“With this commitment, Costco is no longer a laggard among its peers. So, we congratulate the company on committing to reduce its contribution to climate change,” said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. “Costco’s plan to set a scope 3 emissions reduction target in 2023 shows that the company is starting to treat climate change with the gravity that the issue – and shareholders – demand.”</p>
<p>Historically, Costco has significantly trailed many of its competitors on climate action, standing out as one of only three of the largest 50 S&#038;P companies without a major climate commitment as of December 2021. At Costco’s January 2022 annual meeting, Green Century called on the company to set science-based emissions reduction targets for its scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions that would lead to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those from a company’s operations and purchased energy, while the emissions from its supply chains and the use of its products are known as scope 3.</p>
<p>In response, Costco committed to disclosing the company’s aggregate scope 3 emissions and action plan in 2022, and to set scope 3 reduction targets in 2023, which likely represents the vast majority of the company’s climate impact. (For context, Walmart* has estimated that for retailers, roughly 95% of emissions are in scope 3.) In addition, Costo committed to updating its scope 1 and 2 emissions targets and action plans as part of its revised Climate Action Plan coming out in December 2022.</p>
<p>“Costco has certainly accelerated its work on this issue and we are pleased that it is heeding the call from shareholders to address climate risk,” said Green Century’s Director of Shareholder Advocacy Annie Sanders. “That said, we are disappointed that the company has declined to pursue alignment of the company’s climate targets with the Science Based Targets initiative, the global body enabling businesses to set emissions reduction targets in line with science. We strongly urge Costco to join its peers in taking this crucial step to avoid the worst consequences of climate change and mitigate climate risk in line with investor expectations.”</p>

<p>BOSTON, November 10, 2022 &#8211; A year after Green Century° filed a shareholder proposal calling on The Timken Company (Timken) to adopt short-, medium- and long-term science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, the company has taken a strong first step toward fulfilling the proposal’s request. Timken has now adopted targets to reduce the intensity of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions (emissions from its direct operations) by 50% by 2030 in its manufacturing facilities with more than 100 employees. </p>
<p>An Ohio-based manufacturer of engineered steel bearings, Timken supplies critical components for the automotive, rail, renewable energy and agricultural industry sectors. In recent years, Timken has experienced double-digit revenue growth in the renewable energy market sector, where its bearings help wind turbine blades turn smoothly and help trackers that hold solar panels reliably follow the sun.  </p>
<p>“We are pleased with Timken’s new commitment to halve its emissions intensity in 8 years’ time,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Capital Management. “It’s a big first step for a company that had no greenhouse gas reduction targets just a year ago. We’re proud to have been a catalyst in its process.”</p>
<p>Timken’s announcement comes as its automotive customers, including BMW, Ford, Mercedes and Tesla, have all set or committed to set science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These commitments, made through the Science Based Targets initiative, mean that auto manufacturers are now accountable for reducing emissions from their full value chain. To meet their objectives, they will likely press suppliers such as Timken to cut their emissions in the not-too-distant future.<br />
“It’s interesting because Timken is part of this economy-wide transition to clean energy, and its products can be found in GE’s 14 MW Haliade-X, the world&#8217;s most powerful wind turbine, and in more than a third of the world’s utility-scale solar projects,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. But, Timken can’t just sell its products to renewable energy companies and pat itself on the back. It has to account for its own contributions to climate change, which is why we welcome its newly announced goal to cut its operational emissions.”  </p>
