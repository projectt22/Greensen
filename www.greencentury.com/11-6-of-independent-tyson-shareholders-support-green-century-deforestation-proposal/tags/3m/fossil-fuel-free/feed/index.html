<p></p>



<p>I recently represented Green Century Funds at the Archdiocese of Boston’s 16th Annual Social Justice Convocation. The event was inspired by Pope Francis’ call to &#8220;every living person on the planet” to recognize the immediate threat of climate change and to care for the environment.</p>



<p><br>This event brought together priests, nuns, parishioners, students, and even Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, all seemingly united in their commitment to making a positive environmental impact in their communities. The people I spoke with were inspired by the belief that their investments could drive meaningful environmental change, with many attending this gathering to green their parishes. Many expressed frustrations with current practices and voiced concerns about the future of our environment.</p>



<p><br>I decided to work at Green Century because I believe the organization offers an impactful way to address environmental challenges. Green Century rethinks traditional investment systems that too often harm the environment. Instead, Green Century offers people an opportunity to invest in a way that follows their environmental values.</p>



<p><br>This convocation was a great place for Green Century, not only because I met individuals who have already invested in the funds, but also because the event reflected a shared commitment to change the status quo. The event showcased a 2,000-year-old institution—the Catholic Church—now dedicated to integrating sustainability into its long-standing tradition. To me, this is a powerful symbol of progress and a beacon of hope. It serves as a reminder that, despite our diverse backgrounds and perspectives, our planet is a shared home, and the responsibility to care for it belongs to all of us.</p>



<p><br>A major part of sustainability is recognizing how we as individuals can act to protect the environment. Green Century is for all types of investors, small and large, and our funds help people invest with their values. I spoke with several people who were interested in environmentally responsible investing as an option.</p>



<p><br>I left the event energized by the spirit of community and the shared sentiment of making choices and acting in ways to help preserve our planet and conserve our natural resources for future generations.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, March 11, 2025</strong> – TD Bank Group, the second-largest Canadian banking company, has agreed to evaluate its net-zero climate emissions goal in governance reviews and clarify the climate expertise on its board. TD committed to these measures in exchange for Green Century<em>°</em>, Investors for Paris Compliance, and Vancity Investment Management withdrawing a recently filed proposal.</p>



<p>The proposal requested an independent review of TD’s board governance policies and director selection criteria with the aim of improving climate risk management and advancing progress toward the bank’s net-zero goal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Banks have a key role to play in the transition to an economy powered by clean energy,” said <strong>Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a></strong>. “We applaud TD’s moves to better address climate risk and show investors that the company is taking its net-zero goals seriously.”</p>



<p><strong>The Significance of Board-Level Climate Expertise and Oversight</strong></p>



<p>TD’s actions align with calls from investors for companies to show how they plan to meet their net-zero commitments. Because getting to net-zero climate emissions requires businesses to navigate new challenges, incorporating climate expertise at the highest level of corporate decision-making is one critical way companies can show investors they’re up to the task.</p>



<p>In 2024, Green Century co-filed a resolution pressing TD for more information on how it would meet its climate emissions reduction goals. That proposal earned 28.8% of the shareholder vote, indicating strong interest from investors in the topic and laying the groundwork for this year’s dialogue with the company.</p>



<p>“TD setting a net-zero target was an important initial step toward addressing its contribution to climate change,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/">Giovanna Eichner</a>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We commend the company for now making sure the board is equipped to implement that net-zero goal and more effectively manage climate risk in the years to come.”</p>

<p>In the face of new attacks on our national environmental laws to protect the air, water and land we cherish, we sometimes feel powerless.</p>



<p>But I know that the best way to handle this challenge is to take all the individual and collective actions that we can. That’s why we will be showcasing ways for you to protect people and the planet in the months to come. With our non-proﬁt owners, we will be offering virtual and hands-on ways to protect pollinators, reduce plastic waste and conserve tropical rainforests.</p>



<p>Where you invest your future savings can make an impact. You can begin right now by starting or adding to your <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century Funds</a> investment. You <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/ira-information/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-SA-Season-Highlights-3.31.24-1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">can open or contribute to an IRA</a>, start an educational savings plan for a relative or read our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fossil Fuel Free Investing Guide</a> to get started. With every investment, you send a message that you won’t support companies that are contributing to wrecking the environment.</p>



<p>We can choose investments that avoid industries that literally fuel climate change and enrich oil, gas and insurance executives or we can put our money where it can beneﬁt the planet. We have choices and the combined power of our investments.</p>



<p>Will you join the thousands of Americans who are sending a message with their investments?</p>



<p>Green Century°, for more than three decades, has selected companies in its three mutual funds that have track records of acting responsibly for our environment.

<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>

Green Century’s proposal asking <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-31-of-ibm-shareholders-support-green-century-climate-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>November 22, 2024, Toronto, Ontario</strong> &#8211; Today, in light of governance concerns at TD Bank, including its money laundering scandal and stalled progress on its net zero commitment, Investors for Paris Compliance, along with Green Century Capital Management, Nomura Asset Management UK, and Vancity Investment Management, have filed a shareholder resolution requesting an independent review of TD’s governance processes, including its board nomination policies.</p>



<p>“In light of the bank’s recently exposed governance failures, we are looking for board accountability and renewal, including that new board members are properly qualified to manage major risks and opportunities.” said Kyra Bell-Pasht, of Investors for Paris Compliance.<br>On money laundering, while TD has said “we take full responsibility,” there has not been an explanation about how the board’s Audit Committee failed to prevent the scandal when it had oversight of relevant systems. While the current CEO will be replaced at the next AGM, to date no board members have indicated they will be resigning to take responsibility.</p>



<p><strong>On Net Zero, TD Fares Poorly<br></strong><br>On net zero, TD fares poorly in a series of independent assessments, and the board is yet to respond to two years of about a quarter of its shareholders expressing concern about its net zero plans. TD currently has three directors – Claude Mongeau, S. Jane Rowe, and Nancy Tower – who also serve as directors of fossil fuel companies. A fourth, Brian Ferguson, is an ex-CEO of a fossil fuel company. No TD director has experience with climate solutions.<br><br>Alex Rowe, of Nomura Asset Management UK, with over €500 billion in AUM, explained their decision to co-file again, this time with an escalated focus on governance:<br>“In Europe, there is increasing pressure for us to fulfill our own net zero commitments, which means escalating engagements with companies in our portfolio that are failing to progress on their net zero commitments, like TD.”<br><br>Giovanna Eichner of Green Century Capital Management°, explained:<br>“As one of the longest-standing sustainable asset managers in North America, we have long understood the value proposition of considering externalities. This is why we want to ensure TD Bank has leadership in place to foresee and manage key existing and emerging risks.”<br><br>Morrigan Simpson-Marran/ Kelly Hirsch, of Vancity Investment Management explained that:<br>“Our members have made it clear that short-term profits are less important than long-term economic stability and the health of our planet. That is why we encourage companies in our investment portfolio to progress on their net zero commitments. We are now looking for assurance that TD leadership is up to the task.”<br><br>Investors for Paris Compliance works with investors to hold Canadian publicly traded companies accountable to their net zero promises.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">Giovanna Eichner found the prospect of effecting change at companies as a worthy and compelling endeavor, so she jumped at a chance to join Green Century° in August as a shareholder advocate.<br><br>Green Century’s award-winning shareholder advocacy team of four people uses the Green Century’s stake as a shareholder to convince companies to change practices for the health of our planet. The team has won victories in a broad swath of issues and industries, including commitments to cut plastics use, protect forests, and reduce carbon footprints.<br><br>The David vs. Goliath dynamic reminded Giovanna of her environmental advocacy efforts at Boston College, where her student government helped convince the college to improve its environmental practices. Their efforts ranged from increasing funding for composting to cutting food waste.<br>“At Green Century, I saw a similar dynamic at play with advocacy and bigger institutions. I was really excited about pursuing climate policies in a way that was advantageous to both,” she said. “I think shareholder advocacy combines both of those elements and really values it.”<br><br><img decoding="async" width="301" height="226" class="wp-image-23532" style="width: 301px;" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg 2420w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1536x1153.jpeg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-2048x1537.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><br><br>Giovanna said she works on climate issues across a dozen industries, ranging from footwear and apparel to insurance and fast-food restaurants. The companies she negotiates with are mostly big-name brands and are in industries that are high carbon emitters. She said Green Century’s strategy also resonated with her.<br><br>“Green Century’s approach is one where you’re looking to make the case to a big institution in a way that benefits them. You must understand and empathize with the other side and convince them that our values are aligned. That is how you get them to buy in!”<br><br>A Somerville resident, Giovanna looks forward to a chance to connect with people who work at Green Century’s nonprofit owners and partners that own the mutual fund firm on campaigns that overlap, and that helps amplify the impact of Funds investors.<br><br>“The nonprofit ownership really stood out to me,” she said. “It shows how Green Century aligns investments with its values by taking all its net profits back to ownership. I also see how collaboration extends beyond financing – there is potential for teamwork on <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">Right to Repair</a>, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">plastics</a> and other issues. We can really support each other. I like how Green Century not only has the values, but also exhibits this with action.&#8221;<br><br>Giovanna grew up in Rockville, Md., and double majored in German and history at Boston College. She taught English in Hamburg on a Fulbright grant for two years, working on community efforts to protect parklands and the diverse bird, plant and other ecological treasures.<br>Giovanna will help press companies for climate policies and practices that help the environment.

<p>Five years ago, I decided to make a significant career change. Before that, I had spent a couple of decades as a fundraiser and fundraising strategist for nonprofit organizations and political campaigns. The work was fulfilling and impactful, but I wanted to do even more to make a difference on environmental issues.&nbsp; Future generations deserve a healthy planet.</p>



<p>I joined Green Century because I thought the firm’s approach to shareholder advocacy was the best in the business and offered a path toward generating an immediate positive impact for the environment. We just released <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-SA-Season-Highlights-6.30.24-1.pdf">our impact report</a> on the last year in advocacy, and it’s an impressive set of results that follows many years of similarly impressive results – and it’s not just me who thinks so. Others have told us that Green Century “punches above its weight” in holding corporations accountable for protecting the planet, and I’m thankful to be part of this team.</p>



<p>I have learned so much in these five years, and so I thought I would share five observations:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sustainable investing is everywhere. I was hired by <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds, because she was looking for someone who could help expand our investor base beyond New England, New York, and the West Coast. I’m located in Chicago, and I am responsible for the midwestern and southeastern states. I have spent a good amount of time building relationships with people in Chicago, Atlanta, and Minneapolis, but I have also traveled to places like Nashville, Indiana, and Decorah, Iowa. Investors who want to save for their futures while putting their money to work for the planet don’t just reside on the coasts; it’s been my privilege to have a job where I’m tasked with finding them.<br><br></li>



<li>I think the controversy around ESG is misguided. Five years ago, I learned that making use of environmental, social and governance factors in your management of a portfolio may help to reduce risk. It’s a data point &#8211; it’s not screening and it’s not shareholder advocacy. Having previously worked in politics, I shouldn’t be surprised at what things get politicized but here we are. I’m sticking to what I originally learned. ESG is a data point, and it shouldn’t be construed as controversial. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-proposed-texas-bill-undermines-insurers-ability-to-fulfill-their-core-mandate-assessing-risk/">Check out this statement</a> we released when the state of Texas considered legislation that would limit the ability of insurance companies operating in the state to consider environmental risks as determinative factors when underwriting property and casualty risks.<br><br></li>



<li>Commitment matters. Green Century has been helping people save for their futures without compromising their values since 1991. That’s almost 35 years with a consistent approach to screening out the most environmentally dangerous industries and pressing the companies that we own to do better by the planet. We are not new to this, and our commitment has not wavered. In a growing number of investment options and a confusing landscape, our experience and consistency matters. As Leslie recently said, “We won’t stray from our mission because our values are baked into our DNA.”<br><br></li>



<li>Our ownership structure is unique. We’re owned by public health and environmental nonprofits, and I believe this aspect separates us from others in the field. I’m proud that the profits we generate managing our funds go to organizations who are making a difference on critical issues, not lining the pockets of an executive c-suite. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Ownership-6.30.24.pdf">Check out this piece to learn more.</a><br><br></li>



<li>The people in this field are inspiring. The pictures tell the story, and I have hundreds of them on my phone from the events that I’ve done with Green Century. I get to work with remarkable people every day, such as: <br><br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.firstaffirmative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Affirmative</a> and <a href="https://www.ussif.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US/SIF</a> whose conferences provide critical information and inspiration</li>



<li><a href="https://naturalinvestments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural Investments</a> and <a href="https://www.fairplanetadvisors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fair Planet Advisors,</a> firms that are similarly committed to values-aligned investing</li>



<li>Financial Advisors that I get to support (James Brewer from <a href="https://www.envisionwealth.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Envision Wealth Planning</a>, <a href="https://naturalinvestments.com/advisors/panek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sylvia Panek</a> and <a href="https://naturalinvestments.com/advisors/vanwinkle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carrie VanWinkle</a> from Natural Investments, and Fran Goldman from <a href="https://www.frangofinancial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frango Financial</a> just to name a few)<br><br></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Obviously, my own team; they’re amazing!</li>
</ul>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Insurance companies like Markel, that write policies to protect property and people, have to predict how climate change could potentially ruin their profits,&#8221; said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “We believe the insurance industry must rapidly transition away from supporting heavy emitters, like fossil fuel companies, and toward clean, renewable energy.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

However, the company does not disclose strategies for aligning its business activities with the emissions reductions called for in the Paris Agreement.

					<p><strong>Boston, May 20, 2024</strong>  – <a href="https://www.travelers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travelers’*</a> investors voted May 15th on a Green Century<em>°</em>  <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/86312/000008631224000023/trv-20240402.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shareholder proposal</a> asking the company to engage, educate, and hold fossil fuel industry clients accountable for eliminating methane emissions from their operations. 15.5% of the votes cast were in favor of the proposal.</p>
<p>“We hope Travelers takes investor concern seriously and commits to help clients reduce methane emissions,&#8221; said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Insurance companies, which are directly dealing with the costs of climate change, would be well served to reduce carbon pollution wherever possible.”</p>
<p>Based in New York City and incorporated in Minnesota, Travelers is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the United States, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/86312/000008631224000012/trv-20231231.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dating back to 1853</a>. In addition to providing homeowner, car, and rental insurance, Travelers also insures oil and gas well operators, owners, and contractors, as well as pipelines. Through direct releases, flaring, and leaks, these operations emit methane, a greenhouse gas that is <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-secretive-methane-leaks-are-driving-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80 times more potent than carbon dioxide</a> over a 20-year period.</p>
<p><strong>Methane emissions accelerate global warming and harm public health</strong></p>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that more than half of the global warming over the next two decades will be caused by the <a href="https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/methane_rule_health_fact_sheet_reboot_final_no_citations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued release of methane</a> and other short-lived pollutants released into the atmosphere. In addition, <a href="https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/methane_rule_health_fact_sheet_reboot_final_no_citations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">methane emissions contain toxic chemicals,</a> which can cause serious health impacts to people living near oil and gas extraction sites.</p>
<p>“We believe Travelers should act quickly to reduce its exposure to the fossil fuel industry and mitigate climate risk,” said Annie Sanders, Green Century’s director of shareholder advocacy. “We encourage the company to take commonsense steps to address methane emissions in its underwriting portfolio as soon as possible.”</p>
