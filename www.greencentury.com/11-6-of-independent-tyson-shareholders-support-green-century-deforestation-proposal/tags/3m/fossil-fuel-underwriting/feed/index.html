<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 14.8% of votes cast on Wednesday supported a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the insurer Markel Group to disclose the climate emissions from its underwriting, investing and insuring activities. The Virginia-based company has grown from <a href="https://www.mklgroup.com/who-we-are/our-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering small buses</a> to insuring a range of properties from boats to <a href="https://www.markel.com/international/london/energy/downstream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oil refineries</a> over its 95 years of operation.  </p>



<p>“Insurers’ pursuit of short-term profits from fossil fuels guarantees long-term environmental and financial costs,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.&nbsp;</strong> “It makes no sense for any business to willingly and knowingly contribute to something &#8212; in this case, climate change &#8212; that causes such large payouts. Investors deserve to know how Markel’s emissions drive the climate risks its business is losing money from.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/is-climate-change-increasing-the-risk-of-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural disasters increase</a> in frequency and severity due to climate change, so do the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulties insurers face in pricing risk</a> and recovering losses from climate disasters. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2023 <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded $100 billion</a> for the fourth consecutive year and the Swiss Re Group projects they could <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double within the next ten years</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impacts of increasing emissions extend to homeowners as well. Insurers are increasingly abandoning areas vulnerable to climate change-fueled severe weather by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/18/homeowners-insurance-california-florida-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to renew policies</a> at the end of their term. A congressional investigation revealed that climate change has spurred <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiking non-renewal rates</a> by insurers and <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher premiums</a> for customers. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more th</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 counties</a> across the United States, the rate of non-renewal has tripled or more since 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Markel is quiet on climate impact&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a professed <a href="https://www.markel.com/about-us/company-responsibility#5927E3E9394A46A29A73467F1A9B4CA4-tab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to environmental stewardship</a>, Markel does not report any of its climate emissions or publish an annual sustainability report. This places the company far behind competitors including <a href="https://asset.trvstatic.com/download/assets/Travelers_TCFDReport2023.pdf/93114e88b97011efa5e28e42e80f1a8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travelers</a>* and <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIG</a>, both of which disclose their operational emissions and are expanding efforts to measure the emissions associated with their investments. Markel is also out of step with the vast majority of other companies in the Russell 1000 index – which represents the biggest companies in the U.S. – 93% of which published a <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/nc/storage/press-releases/article/ga-institutes-research-shows-2023-sustainability-reporting-at-record-levels-as-us-public-compani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustainability report in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, investors and consumers will foot the bill for Markel’s lack of transparency and failure to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Understanding the scope of Markel’s unwriting, investing and insuring of fossil fuels is the first step in responding to these risks to both pocketbooks and the planet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have had a terrific 2023 and have made great strides in helping protect our planet and in making the world a better place through our robust shareholder advocacy, nonprofit ownership, and environmentally responsible funds. Here are some highlights.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Renewable energy plans for top chipmakers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-18785 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Silicon chips are found everywhere these days &#8212; in computers, cell phones, cars, and other consumer and industrial products. Green Century helped convince five top chipmakers to map out their paths to cut carbon emissions. This industry-wide win included some familiar names &#8212; Intel Corporation*, Texas Instruments*, as well as NVIDIA*, Advanced Micro Devices* and ON Semiconductor*. We’re pleased these companies agreed to specify the actions and milestones they will take to reduce carbon and source more renewable energy for the health of our planet.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Convincing insurers to move away from fossil fuels</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-18786 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this year brought more frequent hurricanes, tornadoes, and intense storms due to climate change. Consequently, several insurance companies have stopped issuing new policies for homeowners in California and Florida because of mounting claims. We think it makes sense for them to stop offering insurance coverage to the very industry that has driven these problems. That’s why Green Century led the second year of our campaign to get insurers to stop underwriting and supporting new oil and gas projects. This year, Chubb*, one of the world’s largest insurance companies, agreed to announce it would immediately stop insuring oil and gas projects in conservation areas. This means that worldwide nature reserves, wilderness areas, and marine protected areas will be better safeguarded.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Deforestation rates hit decades-low in Indonesia</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Did you know that for decades tropical forests were destroyed for the cultivation of palm oil, which is found in products ranging from crackers, cookies, and cosmetics, and that Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil? Burning those forests eliminates habitats for orangutans, Sumatran Elephants and other wildlife while releasing tons of carbon pollution into the air.</p>
<p>So, it’s heartening that deforestation rates have declined steadily each year in Indonesia for the last 10 years. And in 2021, it hit a 22-year low!</p>
<p>For the last 10 years, Green Century has pressed companies to switch to producing, trading, buying, and changing how palm oil is grown in Indonesia to protect the environment and this year, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kraft-heinz-sets-global-policy-to-eliminate-deforestation-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">Green Century convinced Kraft Heinz*</a>, one of the largest food and beverage companies, to adopt the most comprehensive global forest protection policy we have ever seen from a food company.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Met people eager to invest with their values throughout the country </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Green Century traveled to events in every region of the country from Los Angeles to New York City, and wherever we went, we found individuals and financial advisors eager to invest in environmentally responsible ways. From the <em>Land Rally</em> in Oregon to<em> ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) for Impact! </em>in Colorado, we look forward to building on the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/events/">connections and conversations</a> we experienced.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Addressing the plastic pollution crisis</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18787" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture3-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Given the global and growing crisis of plastic pollution, Green Century has redoubled its efforts to encourage companies to recycle, reuse and reduce use of plastics. This year, we engaged companies one-by-one and joined forces with major investors in the <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/plastics-treaty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Global Plastics Treaty</a>, an ambitious global effort to end the age of plastic by 2024 in a legally binding document.</p>
<p>Our latest win involves Costco Wholesale*, one of the largest retailers in the world. Our shareholder advocates convinced Costco to expand its plastics reduction efforts. The company committed to increased plastic footprint disclosures and creating a 5-year plastic action plan. This victory, along with the policies we have secured from 12 other companies including Keurig Dr Pepper*, will help keep plastic out of our oceans and protect wildlife</p>

Our nonprofit partners helped protect nature</strong><span style="background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--base); color: var(--wp--preset--color--contrast); font-family: var(--wp--preset--font-family--system-font); font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--medium);">.</span></p>
<p>Native bees will be less likely to encounter deadly pesticides thanks to new state laws spearheaded by Environment Colorado and Environment California. Together with many allies, they also secured new protections for the Boundary Waters (Minnesota), Bristol Bay (Alaska), Chaco Canyon (New Mexico) and the Grand Canyon region (Arizona). In November, voters approved an Environment Texas-backed $1 billion bond <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/articles/texans-vote-yes-on-1-billion-for-state-parks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to fund the largest expansion of parks in the state history</a>.</p>
<p><strong style="background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--base); color: var(--wp--preset--color--contrast); font-family: var(--wp--preset--font-family--system-font); font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--medium);">4. Won Right to Repair victories for Chromebook users and farmers</strong></p>
<p>Green Century and nonprofit owner, Colorado Public Interest Research Group (CoPIRG) worked together on an effort that led to the Centennial State becoming the first in the nation ensuring farmers can fix their tractors and other equipment.</p>
<p>This victory builds on our earlier engagements with Deere &amp; Company*, the manufacturer of the iconic John Deere tractor and a wide array of other agriculture equipment, to reverse its opposition to the right-to-repair movement. Additionally, Green Century and CoPIRG together called on Google* to extend<a href="https://pirg.org/colorado/articles/when-will-my-chromebook-expire-why-computers-should-be-designed-to-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> software on Chromebooks used by school districts and students across the nation</a>. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/googles-chromebook-extension-is-a-win-in-the-fight-against-e-waste/">Green Century engagement</a> led to the company announcing plans to continue software updates for Chromebooks for up to 10 years starting in 2024. This win means millions of serviceable laptops continued to be used instead of ending up in landfills.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Led the Fossil Fuel Free Movement</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-18796 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FFF-front-page-image-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Green Century became one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds in 2014 and this April we updated our popular <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide-sign-up/">Fossil Fuel Free Investing Guide,</a> co-authored this year with <a href="https://www.greenamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green America.</a>  Get your free copy and listen to our webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA_JM7-KayU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Greening Your Investments</em></a> if you or your family members are interested in joining thousands of individuals and institutions, including Harvard University and the Church of England, avoid the coal, oil and gas industry in your investments.</p>

<li><strong>Green Century’s president named to prestigious Barron’s List</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In April, I had the honor of being named to Barron’s <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-funds-president-named-to-prestigious-barrons-list/">100 Most Influential Women in U.S. Finance</a>, joining the ranks of prominent women including Treasury Secretary Janice Yellen and female leaders at the Federal Reserve, International Money Fund, Alphabet, and other places. As one of the very few women recognized in the socially and environmentally responsible investing field, I am heartened that our role in championing values-aligned investing and exposing greenwashing was recognized. We’re proud to help people understand the significant differences between investing strategies and shareholder engagement that sets Green Century apart from others.</p>

<li><strong> We appreciate investors – like you!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our top highlight is our supportive Green Century Funds investors. Our efforts to hold corporations accountable would not have happened without you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many investors – and especially Green Century Funds° investors – can imagine a safer, healthier fossil fuel-free future. That’s why Green Century’s advocates work to convince companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect forests, source renewable energy and more. But as wildfires, floods and extreme temperatures have become more common and climate risk has grown for businesses, we’ve focused on another key driver of the climate crisis: the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Oil and gas corporations need insurance to move forward with fossil fuel exploration and extraction. By refusing to cover these environmentally harmful projects, insurance companies could play a positive role in addressing climate change and avoid significant climate risk: global insured losses from natural disasters last year were estimated at $132 billion, making 2022 the fifth costliest year for insurers on record.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_17513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17513" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17513" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230524_121438-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17513" class="wp-caption-text">Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger poses outside Travelers’ annual meeting before presenting Green Century Funds’ proposal to phase out coverage of new fossil fuel projects.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>While some European companies have stated they will no longer insure certain types of new oil and gas projects, the U.S. insurance industry has made no such moves. In fact, as U.S. insurers continue to cover major drivers of the climate crisis, they’re sticking customers with the costly consequences: State Farm,* the largest homeowner insurance company in California, announced last month that it would stop selling coverage to homeowners – not just in wildfire zones, but everywhere in the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convince U.S. insurers to keep up with evolving global standards and avoid future losses associated with a warming planet, Green Century led a shareholder advocacy program this year with three of the world’s largest insurers: Chubb*, The Hartford*, and Travelers,* asking each company to phase out the underwriting of new fossil fuel projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our dialogues with each company were informative, but none agreed to phase out new fossil fuel projects. The Green Century Funds filed shareholder resolutions with the companies so that shareholders could weigh in on whether insurers should continue to underwrite some of the activities most directly responsible for warming our planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no climate-related proposals at insurance companies won majority support this shareholder season, Green Century helped the issue gain widespread </span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/fossil-fuel-insurance-is-turning-into-a-climate-change-fight-whats-at-stake-a3e09ce5" data-wplink-edit="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increased board-level discussion, and heightened investor awareness. Going forward, we’ll build on our momentum to drive forwa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd this long-term program to build a green, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuel-free future for our children and grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way you can make an impact is to sign </span><a href="https://pirg.org/take-action/tell-insurance-ceos-stop-insuring-climate-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from our nonprofit owners at PIRG urging these three companies to stop insuring climate risks. Fossil fuels won’t go the way of the dinosaur overnight, but sustained pressure from investors, advocates, and everyday people can and will continue to win meaningful policy change in the years to come.</span></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 15, 2023</strong> – Green Century’s° <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">shareholder proposals</a> filed with The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and The Travelers Companies, Inc. are going to a vote at the companies’ annual general meetings on May 17<sup>th</sup> and May 24<sup>th</sup>, respectively. Green Century filed the proposals in December requesting that the companies phase out underwriting new fossil fuel projects in line with the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit global warming to 1.5℃ over pre-industrial temperatures.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals raise concerns that <a href="https://www.thehartford.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hartford</a> and <a href="https://www.travelers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travelers</a> are exposed to climate risk. Both companies underwrite policies meant to protect customers’ homes and businesses from the impacts of climate-driven catastrophes while simultaneously underwriting policies for the fossil fuel industry, whose emissions amplify the effects of those catastrophes.</p>
<p>“Insurers seem to think developing more gas and oil will somehow ease us into a clean energy transition, but developing new wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure is fundamentally incompatible with protecting people and the planet,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “Insurance should be about protection, not enabling systemic threats like climate change.”</p>
<p><strong>Net-zero goals and insuring new renewables projects are not enough</strong></p>
<p>While both The Hartford and Travelers have adopted partial underwriting exclusions on insuring thermal coal mining, coal plant construction and operation, and tar sands-related risks, neither company has agreed to limit underwriting new oil and gas projects, even in ecologically-sensitive areas like the Arctic. U.S. insurer Chubb*, the largest publicly-traded commercial property and casualty insurer in the world, <a href="https://news.chubb.com/2023-03-22-Chubb-Announces-New-Climate-and-Conservation-Focused-Underwriting-Standards-for-Oil-and-Gas-Extraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March that it will no longer underwrite oil and gas extraction projects in government-protected conservation areas and that it will press existing clients to cut methane leaks and emissions from flaring.</p>
<p>Although The Hartford set a <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2022/The-Hartford-Announces-Goal-Of-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-For-All-Operations-By-2050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal</a> to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across its full range of operations, the company has not announced plans to address how its underwriting strategies support its net-zero commitment. Travelers has neither set a net-zero goal nor has it addressed the incongruency of insuring fossil fuel development with protecting its customers from severe weather enhanced by a warming climate.</p>
<p>“Both The Hartford and Travelers are insuring new renewable energy projects, and we applaud that,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “But developing more renewables is only half the answer. Climate experts tell us that the other half is giving up extracting and burning even more oil and gas. For an industry that relies on science, I hope insurers will extract new oil and gas projects from their underwriting portfolios.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, mmorgenstein@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 22, 2023</strong> &#8211; In response to Green Century<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i> re-filing of a shareholder proposal in December, Chubb Limited, the world’s largest commercial property and casualty insurer, has once again asked the SEC for permission to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block the proposal</a> from its proxy ballot. In 2022, Green Century filed a virtually identical <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">proposal</a> asking the company to stop underwriting new coal, oil and methane gas projects. The SEC denied Chubb’s request. Subsequently, the proposal went to a vote at Chubb’s 2022 annual general meeting and garnered the support of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb/">19.4% of the shareholder votes cast</a>.</p>
<p>Like most U.S. property and casualty insurers, Chubb lags behind its European peers in adopting meaningful exclusions. Despite the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and constraints on fossil fuel supply,<a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/worlds-largest-reinsurer-announces-major-new-oil-and-gas-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">  </a>a number of European property and casualty insurers now exclude more oil and methane gas development in their fossil fuel underwriting.  By contrast, in January 2022, a global NGO insurance campaign identified Chubb as a major underwriter of South American offshore oil and gas drilling projects, providing Brazil’s national oil company coverage for 60% of its general civil liability and 50% of its transport-related risks. This state-owned Brazilian company has the fifth-largest documented oil and gas expansion plans of any oil and gas company in the world.</p>
<p>“It boggles the mind to think that an insurance company would willingly create risk for itself and its shareholders by supporting new fossil fuel supply,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “We have to transition away from fuels that create carbon pollution and drive global warming. And let me be clear: We’re not asking Chubb to summarily cancel existing contracts. We’re asking Chubb to be more forward-thinking about a slice of its business and phase out of underwriting new fossil fuel projects. It’s a low bar to clear considering the existential risk of climate change.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chubb argued to the SEC</a> that Green Century’s proposal should be excluded because it probes too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.</p>
<p>“Chubb’s argument seems to underestimate the intelligence of its shareholders,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “I’m sure many are able to come to the fairly obvious conclusion that insurance policies enabling new coal, oil and gas supplies are fueling increasingly severe climate change impacts. It’s not rocket science.”</p>
