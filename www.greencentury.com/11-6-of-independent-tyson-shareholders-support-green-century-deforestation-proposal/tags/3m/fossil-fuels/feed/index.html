<p><strong>Green Century supports renewable energy sources, despite nuclear power’s resurgence.</strong></p>



<p>As data centers, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and other energy-guzzlers increase demand for power, nuclear energy is being pitched as a solution.<br><br>Data centers already make up roughly 2.5 percent of total U.S. electricity use today, according to <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/articles/a-surge-in-energy-intensive-computing-threatens-americas-renewable-energy-transition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis from Boston Consulting Group</a> — but exploding demand for artificial intelligence could drive that to 7.5 percent by 2030.<br><br>Green Century° remains unabashedly opposed to nuclear power and is unconvinced by arguments that today’s new small modular reactors are safe for people or the environment. Our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/">three mutual funds purposefully exclude fossil fuels</a> because of the associated health and ecological impacts.</p>

<p>Nuclear energy is not clean or safe. Many of us remember the immediate environmental and public health fallouts from the Chernobyl, Fukushima and Three Mile Island disasters. At Chernobyl, a<a href="https://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/resources/health/health-effects-chernobyl-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bout 600 workers at the power plant during the emergency received very high doses of radiation</a> and suffered from <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/radiation-sickness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiation sickness</a>. Those who were exposed to the higher amounts of radiation became sick right away and subsequently died.<br><br>The hundreds of thousands of people who worked as part of the cleanup crews in the years after the accident faced increased risk of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/leukemia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leukemia</a>. Of the approximately 5 million residents of the contaminated areas surrounding, children and adolescents exposed from the Chernobyl accident showed an increased risk of developing <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/thyroid-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thyroid cancer</a>. These “new” small modular reactors. <a href="https://blog.ucs.org/edwin-lyman/five-things-the-nuclear-bros-dont-want-you-to-know-about-small-modular-reactors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, still have potential for failures and are susceptible to the more frequent and intense storms caused by climate change.</p>

<p>Today’s consumers already have safe, clean reliable sources of renewable energy. We don’t need to resort to nuclear power. It’s dangerous and costs more than wind and solar. That’s why Green Century is steadfast in its commitment to avoid investing in nuclear power plants. We believe that any firm representing itself as sustainable or responsible should do the same.<br><br>To learn more about avoiding dirty fossil fuels and dangerous nuclear power plants, get our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Climate-Impact-Report-Indesign.pdf">Clean Energy Issue Impact report</a> and our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide-sign-up/">fossil fuel free guide.</a></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2023</strong> – The Hartford announced the vote results on Friday for a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">Green Century° proposal</a> asking the company to establish a deadline for phasing out underwriting new fossil fuel projects. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/874766/000087476623000076/hig-20230517.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Votes cast in favor reached 8.8%</a>, the same as the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb/">2022 vote outcome of 8.8%</a> for a similar Green Century proposal. Green Century filed the same proposal seeking underwriting restrictions on fossil fuel projects at peer company, Travelers, whose annual meeting of shareholders will be held on May 24th.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals were prompted by reports authored by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  and the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicating how expanding fossil fuel supply is likely to push the world beyond the recommended limit of a 1.5°C temperature rise. The IPCC explicitly reports that exceeding the 1.5°C limit will likely result in dangerous physical risks, and, in some cases, irreversible natural resource damage.</p>
<p>While The Hartford did adopt partial underwriting exclusions for insuring thermal coal mining, coal plant construction and operation, and tar sands-related risks in 2019, it hasn’t extended its exclusions beyond the most heavily-polluting fuels &#8211; even when  climate experts say use of fossil fuels must dramatically decline. In 2022, the company adopted a goal to reach <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2022/The-Hartford-Announces-Goal-Of-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-For-All-Operations-By-2050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net-zero emissions by 2050</a>, but has yet to launch new initiatives in support of its goal.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said: </strong></p>
<p>“Regardless of the vote outcome, Green Century will continue to press The Hartford to fully address its climate risk. Despite its existing exclusions and its net-zero by 2050 goal, we’d like to see The Hartford extend its underwriting exclusions to other dirty fossil fuels, including new oil and gas projects. Insurance companies have a critical role to play in steering us toward a low-carbon economy, but supporting new oil and gas wells, pipelines, and transportation infrastructure will likely lock us into carbon emissions that we simply can’t afford.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Covering the liability and casualty risks of new oil and gas projects is antithetical to protecting the rest of The Hartford’s clients from climate risk. In light of the company’s net-zero goal, I believe Green Century Funds’ proposal is a reasonable request to phase out underwriting new risks for an industry that’s contributed the most to climate change.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, May 2, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gcchubb032723-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In March giving Chubb Limited permission to block Green Century Funds’ </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shareholder proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal requests Chubb adopt a policy for the time-bound phase out of underwriting new coal, oil, and gas projects. Green Century</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed a similar proposal in 2022, asking for an immediate cessation of underwriting new projects. Chubb challenged last year’s proposal, but, at that time, the SEC ruled the proposal could appear on Chubb’s 2022 ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chubb is the largest publicly-traded property and casualty insurance company and is actively involved in underwriting oil and gas project risks. For example, Chubb has previously underwritten policies for controversial fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Trans Mountain pipeline. A 2022 report exposed Chubb as a major underwriter of liability and transportation risks for offshore oil drilling operations for Petrobras – Brazil’s national oil company – which has the </span><a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fifth largest oil and gas expansion plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any oil and gas company in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re disappointed that Chubb did not want its shareholders to vote on this issue and that the SEC supported Chubb’s argument, claiming that our proposal requires shareholders to ‘probe too deeply’ into Chubb’s core business. We think shareholders understand insurance is essential for coal, oil and gas companies, and many do not believe increasingly expensive drilling and its associated emissions are good for business,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve asked Chubb to phase out insurance for new projects that will likely create decades of greenhouse gas  emissions. It’s hard to square how Chubb enables carbon pollution while simultaneously issuing policies to protect people’s homes and businesses from the impacts of climate change.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the SEC’s ruling, Chubb had announced </span><a href="https://about.chubb.com/#:~:text=Chubb%20is%20the%20world&#039;s%20largest,health%20insurance%2C%20reinsurance%20and%20life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new underwriting criteria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for oil and gas extraction projects requiring existing clients to reduce methane emissions. Additionally, Chubb said it would no longer provide coverage for oil and gas projects in state- or nationally-designated protected areas and in certain other conservation areas. Green Century Funds welcomed action but also </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-chubb-announces-new-policy-to-restrict-its-underwriting-of-oil-and-gas-sector-green-century-seeks-details-on-how-effectively-it-will-reduce-carbon-emissions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critiqued the new policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicating that its potential for reducing greenhouse emissions was unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For two years, we have been pressing Chubb to uphold its duty to protect its shareholders and customers from climate risk,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We believe helping the fossil fuel industry is completely contrary to its fiduciary and prudential responsibilities. These actions aid and abet an industry that has done the most to contribute to a warming planet. Insurers like Chubb have to show more leadership because they are on the front lines of experiencing climate risk.”</span></p>
