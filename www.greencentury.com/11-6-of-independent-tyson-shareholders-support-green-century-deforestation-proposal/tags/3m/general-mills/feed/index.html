<p>BOSTON, September 27, 2022 – A noteworthy 55% of General Mills shareholders voted Tuesday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal urging the company to issue a report to determine if and how the company can increase the scale, pace and rigor of its sustainability efforts by reducing plastic packaging. </p>
<p>“It’s clear that plastic packaging pollution is a rising concern among shareholders and consumers alike,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. “No one wants a sea turtle to choke on their cereal bag. Investors have sent an unmistakable message that General Mills needs to do something about its plastic packaging footprint.”</p>
<p>The United States’ plastic recycling rate clocked in at a dismal 5%-6% in 2021, and studies show that corporations need to reduce their absolute use of plastic by one-third by 2040 to bring the plastic pollution problem under control. Some companies are starting to cut plastic voluntarily from their packaging, and those that aren’t may soon have to, legally. Both Colorado and California passed “Extended Producer Responsibility” laws this year that require companies to take responsibility for their waste, and the issue is gaining traction in other state houses across the country.</p>
<p>As a response, in part, to this changing regulatory landscape, General Mills’ competitors including Kellogg’s, Unilever and Procter &#038; Gamble have made public commitments to reduce plastic packaging by 2025. </p>
<p>“The bottom line is that companies know they need to cut plastic, and many are starting to act,” said Annie Sanders, Green Century’s director of shareholder advocacy. “This majority vote from shareholders gives General Mills marching orders to establish a baseline plastic footprint so the company can assess what&#8217;s possible. Investors, consumers  and the planet demand it.”</p>
