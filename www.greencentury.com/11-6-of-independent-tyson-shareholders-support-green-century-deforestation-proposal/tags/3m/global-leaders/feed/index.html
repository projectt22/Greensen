<p>BOSTON, September 22, 2022 &#8212; To coincide with Climate Week, Insider is spotlighting 30 global leaders, including Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich, in its inaugural Climate Action 30 list.</p>
<p>“I’m honored by this recognition from Insider and appreciate Insider’s acknowledgement of the burgeoning interest in the climate crisis,” said Samuelrich. “Hopefully, Insider’s millions of readers will delve deeper into the great work my counterparts on this list are doing and be inspired to take climate action of their own.”</p>
<p>In an email notifying Samuelrich that judges had selected her, Insider said she “stood out because of [her] impactful leadership at Green Century as both an investor and shareholder [advocate]&#8230; on an issue as urgent as climate change — one that our audience cares deeply about.”</p>
<p>Green Century, the first family of diversified and responsible fossil fuel free mutual funds, began in 1991. In the ensuing decades, it has become a leader in environmental investing. Green Century takes a three-pronged approach: building a portfolio of environmentally responsible companies, proposing and executing effective shareholder advocacy and giving 100% of the profits earned from managing the funds to environmental nonprofits.</p>
<p>As a result of its shareholder advocacy, Green Century has won concessions from many major corporations. This summer alone, Green Century proposals spurred Conagra to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains and prompted US Foods to set science-based emissions reduction targets.</p>
<p>“While traditional advocacy methods including grassroots organizing and investigative reports sometimes get companies to do the right thing for the environment, unfortunately, sometimes it takes the threat of shareholder action,” said Samuelrich, who has run Green Century for the past ten years. “Even when dealing with giants such as Amazon, Costco or McDonald’s, we don’t shrink from our fiduciary and societal responsibility to hold companies we invest in accountable to shareholders and the greater good.”</p>
