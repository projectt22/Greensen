<p><b>Boston, June 28, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kraft Heinz,* one of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> food and beverage companies in the world, announced a first-ever <a href="http://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/esg/pdf/GlobalDeforestationandConversionFreePolicy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Deforestation- and Conversion-Free Policy</a> in response to a Green Century Funds° shareholder proposal asking the company to eliminate deforestation across its supply chains by 2025. In exchange, Green Century withdrew its proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To achieve a climate-neutral world by mid-century, companies must drastically cut their contribution to deforestation, which accounts for 12% of global climate </span><a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We commend Kraft Heinz for acting to protect tropical forests, biodiversity and our climate.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Kraft Heinz’s new no-deforestation policy helps protect tropical forests</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraft Heinz’s new stance on deforestation is an expansion of its 2018 </span><a href="https://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/pdf/Kraft_Heinz_Sustainable_Palm_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Palm Oil policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that established a commitment to sustainable palm oil. Notably, the new policy sets a 2025 deadline for eliminating deforestation from key commodities in Kraft Heinz’s global supply chains, aligning with recent </span><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientific consensus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The policy covers commodities including beef and soy that are linked to deforestation in tropical regions such as the Brazilian Amazon, which is </span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-animals-live-in-the-amazon-and-8-other-amazon-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home to ten percent of all known species</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and among the last refuges for endangered species from jaguars and pink river dolphins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agriculture industry is the world’s largest contributor to deforestation, causing 75 percent of the world’s tropical deforestation, and the beef industry alone is responsible for </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some studies show it will be nearly impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees without ending deforestation in </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/climate-math-what-a-1-point-5-degree-pathway-would-take#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beef, soy, palm oil and wood products drive the majority </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of global deforestation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many of which are key ingredients in the Kraft Heinz products’ we know and love – from Oscar Meyer meats to Kraft Mac n’ Cheese,” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century&#8217;s Director of Shareholder Advocacy. “We applaud the company’s commitment to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains, thereby helping to protect forests and biodiversity around the world.”</span></p>
