<p><strong>Boston, March 11, 2025</strong> – TD Bank Group, the second-largest Canadian banking company, has agreed to evaluate its net-zero climate emissions goal in governance reviews and clarify the climate expertise on its board. TD committed to these measures in exchange for Green Century<em>°</em>, Investors for Paris Compliance, and Vancity Investment Management withdrawing a recently filed proposal.</p>



<p>The proposal requested an independent review of TD’s board governance policies and director selection criteria with the aim of improving climate risk management and advancing progress toward the bank’s net-zero goal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Banks have a key role to play in the transition to an economy powered by clean energy,” said <strong>Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a></strong>. “We applaud TD’s moves to better address climate risk and show investors that the company is taking its net-zero goals seriously.”</p>



<p><strong>The Significance of Board-Level Climate Expertise and Oversight</strong></p>



<p>TD’s actions align with calls from investors for companies to show how they plan to meet their net-zero commitments. Because getting to net-zero climate emissions requires businesses to navigate new challenges, incorporating climate expertise at the highest level of corporate decision-making is one critical way companies can show investors they’re up to the task.</p>



<p>In 2024, Green Century co-filed a resolution pressing TD for more information on how it would meet its climate emissions reduction goals. That proposal earned 28.8% of the shareholder vote, indicating strong interest from investors in the topic and laying the groundwork for this year’s dialogue with the company.</p>



<p>“TD setting a net-zero target was an important initial step toward addressing its contribution to climate change,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/">Giovanna Eichner</a>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We commend the company for now making sure the board is equipped to implement that net-zero goal and more effectively manage climate risk in the years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>November 22, 2024, Toronto, Ontario</strong> &#8211; Today, in light of governance concerns at TD Bank, including its money laundering scandal and stalled progress on its net zero commitment, Investors for Paris Compliance, along with Green Century Capital Management, Nomura Asset Management UK, and Vancity Investment Management, have filed a shareholder resolution requesting an independent review of TD’s governance processes, including its board nomination policies.</p>



<p>“In light of the bank’s recently exposed governance failures, we are looking for board accountability and renewal, including that new board members are properly qualified to manage major risks and opportunities.” said Kyra Bell-Pasht, of Investors for Paris Compliance.<br>On money laundering, while TD has said “we take full responsibility,” there has not been an explanation about how the board’s Audit Committee failed to prevent the scandal when it had oversight of relevant systems. While the current CEO will be replaced at the next AGM, to date no board members have indicated they will be resigning to take responsibility.</p>



<p><strong>On Net Zero, TD Fares Poorly<br></strong><br>On net zero, TD fares poorly in a series of independent assessments, and the board is yet to respond to two years of about a quarter of its shareholders expressing concern about its net zero plans. TD currently has three directors – Claude Mongeau, S. Jane Rowe, and Nancy Tower – who also serve as directors of fossil fuel companies. A fourth, Brian Ferguson, is an ex-CEO of a fossil fuel company. No TD director has experience with climate solutions.<br><br>Alex Rowe, of Nomura Asset Management UK, with over €500 billion in AUM, explained their decision to co-file again, this time with an escalated focus on governance:<br>“In Europe, there is increasing pressure for us to fulfill our own net zero commitments, which means escalating engagements with companies in our portfolio that are failing to progress on their net zero commitments, like TD.”<br><br>Giovanna Eichner of Green Century Capital Management°, explained:<br>“As one of the longest-standing sustainable asset managers in North America, we have long understood the value proposition of considering externalities. This is why we want to ensure TD Bank has leadership in place to foresee and manage key existing and emerging risks.”<br><br>Morrigan Simpson-Marran/ Kelly Hirsch, of Vancity Investment Management explained that:<br>“Our members have made it clear that short-term profits are less important than long-term economic stability and the health of our planet. That is why we encourage companies in our investment portfolio to progress on their net zero commitments. We are now looking for assurance that TD leadership is up to the task.”<br><br>Investors for Paris Compliance works with investors to hold Canadian publicly traded companies accountable to their net zero promises.</p>
