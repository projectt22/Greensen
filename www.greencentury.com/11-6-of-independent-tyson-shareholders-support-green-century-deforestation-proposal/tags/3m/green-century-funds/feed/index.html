					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495;</p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p><strong>Boston, March 6, 2024</strong> &#8211; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently finalized its long-awaited <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/33-11275.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate-Related Disclosure rule</a>.</span> Originally proposed two years ago, the rule was crafted in response to investor demand for <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/12/20/why-we-still-need-the-secs-climate-related-disclosures-rule/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20SEC%2C%20the,companies%20in%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent and comprehensive information</a> about climate-related risks and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledgment</a> by federal regulators of such risks to the financial system.</p>
<p>“It’s a step forward, but we feel it&#8217;s too little too late. We wish the SEC had held fast with their proposal to have companies report Scope 3, or indirect, emissions because investors need this data to make informed decisions about how companies are addressing their climate-related risks,” said Green Century Funds° President Leslie Samuelrich. “Companies’ indirect emissions often represent the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%2C%20also%20referred,organizations%20(see%20Figure%201)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority</a> of their total emissions. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/23/sec-expected-to-scale-back-landmark-climate-disclosure-rule-00143046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vigorous opposition</a> by trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation, has restricted investors’ access to vital information.”</p>
<p>The initial draft rule was <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/sec-tees-up-vote-next-week-on-climate-disclosure-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered a victory</a> for investors and <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/news-release-sec-unveils-climate-disclosure-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public interest organizations</a> who were concerned about companies not fully disclosing or downplaying their climate risks. They argued investors could be unknowingly investing billions of dollars in businesses that were not adequately addressing their financial risks.</p>
<p>“Institutional investors have been seeking this information and every day investors would potentially benefit from knowing how the companies in their 401(k), IRAs and other investments are addressing climate risk,” said Samuelrich.</p>
<p>But some business groups opposed the parts of the regulations that require large companies to disclose climate-threatening emissions caused by suppliers and customers and have threatened legal action. However, not including these indirect emissions may result in litigation too. Several nonprofits, including Earthjustice, a leading public interest environmental law nonprofit, indicate they may mount a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-sec-vote-long-awaited-climate-disclosure-rule-notice-says-2024-02-28/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court challenge</a> if major aspects such as indirect carbon emissions, are dropped from the new ruling.</p>
<h3><strong>Regulatory and investor pressure continues  </strong></h3>
<p>Meanwhile, regulatory and investor pressure continues. The new <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Corporate Climate Accountability Act</a> and the European Union’s <a href="https://dart.deloitte.com/USDART/home/publications/deloitte/heads-up/2023/csrd-corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive,</a> will require larger companies to begin reporting their Scope 3 emissions in 2027 and 2025, respectively.</p>
<p>And while mandatory reporting is preferred, many companies already willingly report the greenhouse gas emissions from their operations and supply chains. Green Century recently has worked with several companies, including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-green-century-shareholder-proposal-prompts-costco-commitment-to-set-new-climate-emissions-reduction-targets/">Costco,</a> * <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kroger-to-set-science-based-emissions-reduction-targets-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">Kroger</a>, * and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/corning-sets-ambitious-target-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-embraces-development-of-climate-transition-plan/">Corning</a>* and convinced them to report on their carbon emissions, including Scope 3 emissions.</p>
<p>“Smart companies have recognized climate change as a material risk and already are taking steps to address it. As we say, what gets measured gets managed, and isn’t every investor looking for a well-managed company?” said Samuelrich.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, some important aspects of the rule remain in place.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">The SEC will require companies to explain how severe weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, drought and other natural catastrophes impact their strategies, operations, and financial positions when costs to address such events exceed a certain monetary threshold.</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> The rule will also create a framework to improve the consistency of quantifying Scope 1 and 2 emissions data and will phase in a requirement for third-party verification depending on the size of the company.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[(Boston, MA) &#8211; In a positive development for the Right to Repair movement, technology giant Apple Inc* announced it would expand its Self Service Repair program to its newest iPhone [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<p>(Boston, MA) &#8211; In a positive development for the Right to Repair movement, technology giant <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a>* announced it would expand its Self Service Repair program to its newest iPhone 14 and M2 Mac models. The company’s continued commitment is a win for consumer rights and efforts to combat e-waste and came after <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century Funds</a>°, a leading environmentally responsible family of mutual funds, advocated for increasing sustainable business practices at the company.</p>
<p>Green Century initiated discussions with Apple in 2021 and submitted a shareholder proposal later that year asking the company to consider the environmental and social benefits of making its devices more easily repairable by consumers and independent repair shops.</p>
<h2><strong>Green Century Advocacy Creates Long-Term Impact for the Environment </strong></h2>
<p>Through a series of collaborative meetings, Green Century provided Apple with compelling evidence on the positive environmental implications of allowing customers to repair instead of replacing their products. Repairs extend the life of products, help reduce electronic and plastic waste, promote a more circular economy, and aligns Apple’s policy on the issue with its own sustainability goals and commitments.</p>
<p>Green Century’s efforts helped to culminate in Apple announcing for the first time in 2021 that it would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products. Green Century withdrew its shareholder proposal in return for Apple’s commitments.</p>
<p>“True to its slogan, Apple is “Thinking Different” by helping to reduce electronic waste and helping customers hold on to their products longer. Green Century is proud to have played a role in Apple&#8217;s evolving support for Right to Repair and hope that their leadership moves its competitors to follow suit,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</p>
<p>Apple and other technology companies traditionally have lobbied against Right to Repair legislation, so the announcement of its expanded repair commitments carries substantial weight in industry discussions. Americans spend around <a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,700</a> per household a year purchasing new electronic devices, and nearly<a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 7 million tons</a> of American <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/what-is-e-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic e-waste</a> end up in landfills each year.</p>
