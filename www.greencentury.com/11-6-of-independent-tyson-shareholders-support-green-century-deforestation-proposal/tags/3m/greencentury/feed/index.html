					<p><strong>Media Contacts: Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, </strong><a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com"><strong>aranger@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 781-349-2813; </strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>BOSTON, January 19, 2023 </strong>– In exchange for the withdrawal of a Green Century° shareholder proposal, San Diego-based Jack in the Box restaurants  <a href="https://investors.jackinthebox.com/esg/Housing---Sows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it will switch to 100% “group housed” pork by the end of 2026. In this process, breeding pigs are housed in groups rather than restrictive “gestation” crates for at least a majority of each pregnancy cycle. Green Century pressed Jack in the Box to make this transition after a decade of failed promises to do so. Gestation crates confine pregnant sows in spaces that are roughly 2 feet by 7 feet, areas so small that they can’t even turn around. Nine states ban the practice.</p>
<p>“Jack in the Box made a promise in 2012 to eliminate gestation crate usage from its supply chain by 2022 but it didn’t keep its pledge,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Shareholders want companies to uphold their commitments &#8212; and everyone wants to see animals treated as humanely as possible. Companies who fail to do either or both incur reputational risks. We’re pleased to see Jack in the Box finally taking action on this important animal welfare issue.”</p>
<p>Jack in the Box’s competitors have made progress on sourcing pork from suppliers that have reduced or eliminated gestation crates.  McDonald’s will reach 100% “group housed” pork by 2024 in the United States, as will Burger King and Tim Hortons (in both the U.S. and Canada). Wendy’s, Panera Bread and other quick service chains have already achieved that goal in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Whether you’re a fan of Jack in the Box’s bacon double cheeseburger or just an investor worried that your company is not tuned into animal welfare issues and the oft-correlated competitive and reputational damage, Jack in the Box’s new announcement is welcomed news,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “We appreciate that Jack in the Box quickly established a hard cutoff date to switch to 100% group housed pork. There’s no excuse for putting pregnant pigs in the equivalent of animal jail.”</p>
