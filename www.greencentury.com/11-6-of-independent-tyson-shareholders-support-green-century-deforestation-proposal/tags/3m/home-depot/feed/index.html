<p>A shareholder proposal co-filed by Green Century Capital Management called on Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, to conduct a full assessment of its impact on nature and on the risks the company faces from the increasing instability of the natural environment. Company shareholders voted on the proposal at the company’s annual meeting Thursday. The proposal received 17% of votes cast, more than a similar proposal received at the company’s 2024 stockholder meeting.</p>



<p>“Home Depot sells lumber, paints, and herbicides, all of which adversely impact the environment, during either production or use,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company has a responsibility to shareholders and the planet to account for how its business affects nature.”</p>



<p><strong>Investors concerned about the health of the natural world</strong></p>



<p>Climate change, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are stressing the planet. In this context, investors have begun asking companies to fully disclose how their operations, sourcing and sales impact the environment. More than 350 companies have committed to providing a comprehensive accounting of these actions under the <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure</a>.  The proposal co-filed by Green Century asks Home Depot to provide a similar assessment. The initiative was led by Domini Impact Investments and was also supported by Proxy Impact on behalf of the Great Oaks Fund.</p>



<p>University of British Columbia Prof <a href="https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/suzanne-simard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanne Simard</a>, author of <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest</em>, presented the proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. In her remarks, Simard, a professor of forest ecology, described the important role of forests in mitigating climate change and how industrial logging degrades the health of forests. Home Depot sources approximately 17% of its lumber <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the pristine Canadian boreal</a> forests. Studies have documented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe long-term damage</a> from forestry practices in the boreal and how the increasing rate and severity of wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/12/climate/canada-wildfires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hampered the forest’s ability to recover and regrow</a>.</p>



<p>“Home Depot needs to do a better job of taking care of the home we all share: Earth,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“No one’s going to build a new deck when a wildfire’s burning in the back yard.”</p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, <a href="mailto:tpeterson@greencentury.com">asanders@greencentury.com</a>, 773-272-6691</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, March 27, 2024</strong> – The Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that shareholder proposals seeking protections for the Okefenokee swamp from a titanium mine can be excluded from voting at the 2024 annual meetings of The Chemours Company, Sherwin-Williams and Home Depot. The proposals were filed by Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, and the Felician Sisters of North America.</p>
<p>“While we are disappointed that these companies chose to challenge our proposals rather than evaluate scientifically supported protections for the Okefenokee, we were pleased to learn they have no near-term plans or intent to support mining at this natural treasure,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “As a massive carbon sink and one of the world’s largest intact freshwater <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wetlands</a>, the Okefenokee is the last place we should be mining for anything.”</p>
<p>Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015, manufactures and sells “performance chemicals,” including titanium dioxide. In 2022, Chemours publicly pledged to avoid mining at, or buying minerals from, the swamp in the near term. Following that commitment, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211206005266/en/Hyperion-Signs-MoU-With-Chemours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a long-term contract</a> to secure titanium dioxide from a Tennessee mine which, combined with its other operations in Georgia and Florida, appears to provide a long-term supply.</p>
<p>Sherwin-Williams is a global leader in paints and coatings, and Home Depot is a major carrier of titanium dioxide-based paint. Headquartered in Atlanta, Home Depot’s resistance to protecting a natural resource special to customers, employees, and other stakeholders raises particular concern.</p>
<p>“We will remain steadfast in our commitment to work to protect the Okefenokee,” shared Sister Jean Sliwinski, Sustainability Coordinator, Felician Sisters of North America. “We urge Chemours, Home Depot and Sherwin Williams to strengthen their commitments and help protect this international treasure by publicly pledging to permanently avoid Okefenokee titanium.”</p>
<p><strong>Draft Permits Issued Last Month, Moving Mine Forward</strong></p>
<p>Draft <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife." target="_blank" rel="noopener">permits</a> to allow Twin Pines Minerals, LLC to mine titanium on Trail Ridge, the line of inland sand dunes that help hold water in the Okefenokee, were issued last month by Georgia regulators, putting it on the cusp of approval after a five-year battle. The company has also <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/the-fight-over-a-mine-planned-on-the-okefenokee-swamps-edge-may-have-only-just-begun/5UJMY6PHQFBMXE6TFVHLYKJHJU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicated it has plans to expand to mine more land on the swamp’s edge in the future</a>.</p>
<p>Scientific consensus indicates that Twin Pines’ project would <a href="https://www.wabe.org/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly damage the Okefenokee</a> by drawing down its water level while raising drought and fire risks. Such events could destroy swamp wildlife habitat, damage thousands of acres of adjacent private timberland, and release significant carbon emissions.</p>
<p>“Mining near an ecological gem to make white paint is rife with risks,” said Annie Sanders, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “The absurdity of the prospect would be laughable if it weren’t so shocking that companies actually want to leave this door open.”</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://www.wabe.org/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 comments</a> were submitted to Georgia’s Environmental Protection Division opposing TPM’s draft Mining Land Use Plan in early 2023, and in early March 2024, 100 people testified against mining at a public hearing held by that agency. Because of its conservation and cultural importance, Okefenokee is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/okefenokee-wildlife-refuge-unesco-world-heritage-site-499cd975a576658966f7abef26dbba1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being nominated</a> for inclusion on UNESCO’s World Heritage Site List. In addition, the Okefenokee also stores over 400M tons of CO2 equivalent, making it one of the largest natural carbon sinks in North America.</p>

<p>Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, <a href="mailto:tpeterson@greencentury.com">asanders@greencentury.com</a>, 773-272-6691 Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, November 30, 2023</strong> – Green Century Capital Management° has filed a shareholder proposal at The Home Depot asking the company to address risks associated with potential titanium mining along the eastern boundary of Georgia’s Okefenokee Swamp. Headquartered in Atlanta, Home Depot is a major carrier of titanium dioxide-based paint. Green Century was joined in the filing by the Felician Sisters of North America, a national order of catholic sisters that seek to leverage societal change through shareholder advocacy.</p>
<p>“Home Depot acknowledges that sustainability efforts make its business stronger, more agile, and more resilient,” said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. “A permanent commitment to protect the Okefenokee would do just that.”</p>
<p>At 438,000 acres, the Okefenokee Swamp is one of the world’s largest intact freshwater <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wetlands</a>. More than 402,000 acres are protected in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the largest refuge in the eastern United States and home to hundreds of plant and animal <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/okefenokee/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">species</a>. The Okefenokee also stores over 400M tons of CO2 equivalent, making it one of the largest natural carbon sinks in North America.</p>
<p>Twin Pines Minerals, LLC has <a href="https://onehundredmiles.org/okefenokee/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife." target="_blank" rel="noopener">applied for permits</a> to mine titanium on Trail Ridge, the swamp’s eastern hydrologic boundary. Scientific consensus indicates that Twin Pines’ project would <a href="https://www.wabe.org/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly damage the Okefenokee</a> by drawing down its water level and increasing risk of drought and landscape-level <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/01/georgia-okefenokee-swamp-twin-pines-mining" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fires</a>. Such events could destroy swamp wildlife habitat, damage thousands of acres of adjacent private timberland and release significant carbon emissions.</p>
<p>“Pope Francis, in his encyclical, On Care For Our Common Home, states: ‘The earth’s resources are also being plundered because of short-sighted approaches to the economy, commerce and production,’” said Sister Jean Sliwinski, sustainability coordinator with Felician Sisters of North America. “Mining along the edge of this resource puts too much at risk with the potential for irreversible damage to this fragile ecosystem.”</p>
<p>These concerns have fueled heightened public attention and controversy. Over <a href="https://www.wabe.org/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 comments</a> were submitted to Georgia’s Environmental Protection Division opposing TPM’s draft Mining Land Use Plan in early 2023, and polling indicates that <a href="https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/clear-majority-of-georgians-oppose-mine/article_7bba11f8-2b7e-5368-9a9a-952d4cdd4451.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 70%</a> of Georgians want Governor Kemp to deny TPM’s permits. Furthermore, Okefenokee is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/okefenokee-wildlife-refuge-unesco-world-heritage-site-499cd975a576658966f7abef26dbba1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being nominated</a> for inclusion on UNESCO’s World Heritage Site List, and the issue has received significant media coverage.</p>
<p>While Home Depot has confirmed that its primary paint suppliers do not currently have plans to source TiO2 from the proposed Twin Pines mine, it has not made a public commitment regarding future titanium sourcing.</p>
<p>“Mining has no place near an ecological gem like the Okefenokee,” said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy with Green Century. “With headquarters in the Okefenokee’s backyard, Home Depot has a unique opportunity to bolster its environmental image with customers, employees and shareholders, many of whom care deeply about the swamp’s future, all while protecting the company from serious financial and systemic risks.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 19, 2022 – </strong>At The Home Depot’s annual meeting on Thursday, the company announced that a majority of shareholders approved a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/877232/000121465922005158/o412223px14a6g.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green Century° proposal</a> calling on the world’s largest home improvement retailer to increase its efforts to eliminate deforestation and the degradation of primary forests in its supply chains.</p>



<p><strong>In response, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich</a> issued the following statement:</strong></p>



<p>“It’s a good day for the world’s forests, from Canada’s boreal to the tropical rainforests of South America, and for the species that depend on them. We are pleased that a majority of Home Depot’s shareholders have called on the company to accelerate action to end deforestation and the clear-cutting of old growth trees in its supply chains.</p>



<p>“Destroying ecosystems for a new set of kitchen cabinets is not the bargain that we believe that Home Depot’s customers want. Customers may now be unknowingly purchasing wood logged from endangered forests. The company has the opportunity to change this and use its market power for good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We look forward to working with Home Depot to implement our proposal. These issues require urgent action: The world’s forests, the species that rely upon them, and our climate cannot wait.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 18, 2022 – </strong>At The Home Depot’s annual meeting on Thursday, shareholders will vote on a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000877232/000121465922005158/o412223px14a6g.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a> from Green Century° calling on the world’s largest home improvement retailer to increase “its efforts to eliminate deforestation and the degradation of primary forests in its supply chains.”</p>



<p>“The Home Depot is lagging behind its peers in ensuring that it is not purchasing wood associated with deforestation or harvested from the world’s last remaining unlogged forests, also known as primary forests,” said Green Century president Leslie Samuelrich. “The Home Depot’s customers deserve assurance that the plywood they are buying isn’t coming at the expense of old growth trees and habitat for endangered species.”</p>



<p>As anyone who’s visited the Home Depot has seen, the company is a major buyer of wood. Recently, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jennifer-skene/home-depot-sourcing-wood-products-its-1999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)</a> criticized the retailer for the inadequacy of its wood sourcing policies. Nevertheless, The Home Depot’s board of directors has recommended that shareholders vote against Green Century’s proposal.</p>



<p>Green Century recently <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/lowes-commits-to-comprehensive-reporting-of-its-forest-footprint-will-also-explore-elimination-of-sourcing-from-primary-forests/">withdrew a similar shareholder proposal filed with Lowe’s*</a> after The Home Depot’s largest competitor agreed to comply with the proposal’s request by disclosing the impact of its sourcing on primary forests and developing a strategy to mitigate potential negative outcomes associated with its wood sourcing for the climate, biodiversity and human rights.</p>



<p>“This proposal gives The Home Depot’s shareholders an opportunity to urge the company to use its buying power to encourage truly sustainable forestry practices,” said Green Century shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson. “To mitigate global warming and limit biodiversity collapse, we must end deforestation as soon as possible and preserve the world’s remaining primary forests. The company’s opposition to this proposal and its limited forest risk disclosures leave investors concerned that management is not taking the material financial risks associated with deforestation seriously.”</p>



<p>While global deforestation <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2022/04/2021-tropical-forest-loss-figures-put-zero-deforestation-goal-by-2030-out-of-reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues at an alarming pace</a>, investor support for deforestation-related shareholder proposals has increased dramatically in recent years. Green Century proposals on deforestation earned record-breaking majority votes at <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">Procter &amp; Gamble’s</a>* annual meeting in 2020 and at major agribusiness <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">Bunge’s</a>* annual meeting in 2021.</p>
