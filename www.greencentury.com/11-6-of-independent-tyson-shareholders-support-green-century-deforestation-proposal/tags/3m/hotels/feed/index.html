					<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Choice Hotels International*, one of the world&#8217;s leading lodging franchisors, has agreed to take the first step in addressing plastic pollution by conducting a program measure single-use plastic and develop strategies for single-use plastic reduction after engagement by Green Century°.</p>
<p>Choice Hotels, which has a diverse portfolio of 22 brands including Comfort Inn, Cambria Hotels, and Econo Lodge, will conduct a plastics reduction inventory program in 2024 and use it to set a new goal to reduce single-use plastic next year.</p>
<p>“As investors learn that plastic used for a minute can pollute our environment for hundreds of years, it has become a risk that companies need to manage,” said<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</a>. “We welcome Choice Hotel’s move to set a new plastic reduction goal.”</p>
<h4><strong>Choice Hotels, On of The Leading Lodging Franchisors, Agrees to Single-Use Plastic Study, Reduction</strong></h4>
<p>Choice Hotel’s commitment comes as consumers, investors, and regulators increasingly focus on the negative impacts of single-use plastic on the planet. According to a recent survey, 80% of U.S. respondents from across the political spectrum support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic.</p>
<p>“Delighting guests and reducing single-use plastics are clearly compatible,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</a>. “Customers want hospitality that doesn’t compromise the beauty of the places they might have traveled thousands of miles to visit.”</p>
<h4>It is estimated that two garbage trucks worth of plastic enter the ocean every minute.</h4>
<p>Recycling, long touted as the solution to the plastic waste crisis, has resulted in only 9% of plastic being recycled. Scientists and experts agree that the best way to reduce plastic pollution is to cut the amount of plastic companies are producing, and to replace non-essential single-use plastic with tested alternatives like reuseable containers.</p>
<p>“Choice is taking the first steps in addressing plastic pollution by better understanding how and how much plastic is used for its hotels,” added Guernsey. “The next step is to implement reductions, which will return long term value to consumers, the business, and investors.&#8221;</p>

					<h2>Green Century° Files Shareholder Proposals Asking Major Hotels To Cut Plastic</h2>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Dreaming of a pristine tropical escape this season? When you step out of your hotel, in addition to the hot sand between your toes, you may be surprised to find hundreds of plastic containers and bags littering the beach.</p>
<p>Plastic pollution, which often comes from single-use plastics, endangers the world’s most beautiful places by harming biodiversity. Plastic enters the stomachs of seabirds and turtles and damages vital <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01326-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mangrove forests and coral reefs</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18881" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-18881 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Plastic-Beach-Image-300x198.png" alt="" width="300" height="198" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18881" class="wp-caption-text">It is estimated that 32% of plastic ends up in the world&#8217;s oceans each year.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To address financial risk from plastic use, <a href="https://greencentury.com/">Green Century</a>° announced it has filed shareholder resolutions at major hotel brands Hilton*, Marriott*, and Choice Hotels* asking the companies to measure, disclose, and reduce their plastic use.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we are headed the exact wrong direction with plastic pollution,” said<strong> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</strong>. “Corporations have created a growing tidal wave of single-use plastic that is damaging our cherished coastlines.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_18883" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18883" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-18883 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Plastic-Waste-Chart.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="212" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18883" class="wp-caption-text">Plastic pollution has more than doubled in the past 20 years. Only 9% of plastic is recycled. Source: Geyer R, Jambeck JR, Law KL. Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made. Sci Adv. 2017 Jul 19;3(7):e1700782</figcaption></figure>
<p>While there are many causes of plastic pollution at our favorite destinations, the hotel industry is often overlooked. Hotels supply millions of single-use plastic bottles, bags, mini toiletry bottles, and cups wrapped in plastic each year. Experts suggest that <a href="https://sustainablehospitalityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Plastic-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">32% of all plastic packaging ends up in the ocean</a>, and that at least <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/573b9090b654f9dc21f8a630/t/5bf91ac4352f534626c7c372/1543051980482/ABPCO.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15%</a> of plastic used by hotels and conferences is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Consumers are increasingly concerned by the single-use plastic crisis, with a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/75-people-want-single-use-plastics-banned-global-survey-finds-2022-02-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters global survey suggesting that 75% of the world’s population would support a single-use plastic ban</a>. Yet, hotel chains are lagging in acknowledging and addressing their contribution to the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;What gets measured gets managed, and these hotel chains are not measuring their plastic habit,” said<strong> Douglass Guernsey, a Green Century shareholder advocate working on the circular economy</strong>. “Hotels need to understand the amount of plastic waste they are creating and then set goals for reducing it.”</p>
<p>Single-use plastic regulations have gone into effect in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-02-27/the-eu-is-cracking-down-on-plastic-will-other-countries-follow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU</a>, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/accc11/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/india/india-bans-single-use-plastic-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">India</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/06/30/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-cutting-harmful-plastic-pollution-to-protect-communities-oceans-and-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> and elsewhere around the <a href="https://www.globalplasticlaws.org/map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world</a>. Also, investors are concerned that companies’ contributions to plastic pollution may affect shareholder value and cause environmental harm. <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/en/2023/05/investors-with-us10-trillion-aum-call-on-corporates-to-drastically-ramp-up-action-on-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investors representing US $10 trillion</a> in assets signed a statement in 2023 urging immediate cuts to single-use plastic.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18880" style="width: 624px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-18880 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ocean-Plastic.png" alt="" width="624" height="414" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18880" class="wp-caption-text">Plastic pollution is a major contributor to biodiversity loss</figcaption></figure>
<p>Measuring a company’s footprint can be complex, but it is an increasingly common practice. In 2023, <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/plastics/3-000-companies-disclose-plastic-impacts-for-the-first-time-ahead-of-landmark-global-plastics-treaty-negotiations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDP plastic</a>, the sustainability disclosure platform, saw companies worth US $31 trillion voluntarily share information related to their plastic footprint.</p>
<p>Green Century has worked with many notable brands to address corporate plastic footprints, including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/costco-steps-up-efforts-to-reduce-plastic-in-response-to-green-century-proposal/">Costco</a> which recently pledged to share the plastic footprint of its Kirkland Signature brand in Q3 of 2024.</p>
<p>“Nothing we use for less than a minute should pollute our environment for hundreds of years,” said Guernsey. “Our shareholder proposals ask Marriott, Hilton, and Choice to take the commonsense step of measuring their plastic footprints and figuring out what they can cut.”</p>
