<p><strong>Boston, May 16, 2025</strong> – Chubb’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century° shareholder proposal calling for the company to disclose the climate emissions associated with its investing, underwriting and insuring activities. 13.9% of shareholders cast their votes in favor of the proposal. Chubb is one of the<a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/chubb/67002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> largest publicly traded property and casualty insurers</a>, operating in 55 countries across the globe.</p>



<p>“Investors deserve to know how Chubb’s emissions are driving the climate risks disrupting its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “It’s absurd for Chubb to underwrite activities that cause climate change and then turn around and pay for the claims and payouts caused by these activities.”</p>



<p><a></a>As climate change intensifies, <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/01/09/807524.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurers are increasingly on the hook</a> after more frequent and severe natural disasters. At the same time, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-01-31/insurance-companies-fossil-fuel-industry-eaton-palisades-fire-essential-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many continue to insure fossil fuel projects</a> that exacerbate the losses from those events. Many major insurance companies such as <a href="https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allianz</a> and <a href="https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:52d75760-2c43-4d96-be2f-0514382ac51a/2023-sustainability-report-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Re</a>* have begun disclosing the emissions associated with their fossil fuel clients, increasing transparency on their role in intensifying the climate crisis.</p>



<p><strong>Chubb insures climate risks</strong></p>



<p>Last year’s wildfires in Los Angeles and destructive hurricane season in the Atlantic have sparked concern about a climate-driven insurance crisis. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 had the most billion-dollar climate-related disasters</a> in one year. Insurance companies are increasingly unable to withstand growing losses without raising prices or reducing coverage in high-risk areas.</p>



<p>Chubb has noticed the impact of climate change on its bottom line. Following an estimated <a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/chubb-estimates-1-5bn-loss-from-la-wildfires-amid-reduced-california-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 billion dollars in losses</a> from the 2024 California fires, Chubb’s Chief Executive Evan Greenberg warned: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pricier-insurance-makes-sense-as-climate-risk-grows-chubb-ceo-says-5e5d53b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The cost of climate change, to state the obvious: Going up.”</a></p>



<p>“The companies that are supposed to protect us from the consequences of climate change are also fueling its disastrous effects,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Chubb reporting the emissions from its underwriting, investing, and insuring would demonstrate accountability and an intent to reduce its climate impact.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have had a terrific 2023 and have made great strides in helping protect our planet and in making the world a better place through our robust shareholder advocacy, nonprofit ownership, and environmentally responsible funds. Here are some highlights.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Renewable energy plans for top chipmakers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-18785 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Silicon chips are found everywhere these days &#8212; in computers, cell phones, cars, and other consumer and industrial products. Green Century helped convince five top chipmakers to map out their paths to cut carbon emissions. This industry-wide win included some familiar names &#8212; Intel Corporation*, Texas Instruments*, as well as NVIDIA*, Advanced Micro Devices* and ON Semiconductor*. We’re pleased these companies agreed to specify the actions and milestones they will take to reduce carbon and source more renewable energy for the health of our planet.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Convincing insurers to move away from fossil fuels</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-18786 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this year brought more frequent hurricanes, tornadoes, and intense storms due to climate change. Consequently, several insurance companies have stopped issuing new policies for homeowners in California and Florida because of mounting claims. We think it makes sense for them to stop offering insurance coverage to the very industry that has driven these problems. That’s why Green Century led the second year of our campaign to get insurers to stop underwriting and supporting new oil and gas projects. This year, Chubb*, one of the world’s largest insurance companies, agreed to announce it would immediately stop insuring oil and gas projects in conservation areas. This means that worldwide nature reserves, wilderness areas, and marine protected areas will be better safeguarded.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Deforestation rates hit decades-low in Indonesia</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Did you know that for decades tropical forests were destroyed for the cultivation of palm oil, which is found in products ranging from crackers, cookies, and cosmetics, and that Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil? Burning those forests eliminates habitats for orangutans, Sumatran Elephants and other wildlife while releasing tons of carbon pollution into the air.</p>
<p>So, it’s heartening that deforestation rates have declined steadily each year in Indonesia for the last 10 years. And in 2021, it hit a 22-year low!</p>
<p>For the last 10 years, Green Century has pressed companies to switch to producing, trading, buying, and changing how palm oil is grown in Indonesia to protect the environment and this year, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kraft-heinz-sets-global-policy-to-eliminate-deforestation-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">Green Century convinced Kraft Heinz*</a>, one of the largest food and beverage companies, to adopt the most comprehensive global forest protection policy we have ever seen from a food company.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Met people eager to invest with their values throughout the country </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Green Century traveled to events in every region of the country from Los Angeles to New York City, and wherever we went, we found individuals and financial advisors eager to invest in environmentally responsible ways. From the <em>Land Rally</em> in Oregon to<em> ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) for Impact! </em>in Colorado, we look forward to building on the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/events/">connections and conversations</a> we experienced.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Addressing the plastic pollution crisis</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18787" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture3-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Given the global and growing crisis of plastic pollution, Green Century has redoubled its efforts to encourage companies to recycle, reuse and reduce use of plastics. This year, we engaged companies one-by-one and joined forces with major investors in the <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/plastics-treaty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Global Plastics Treaty</a>, an ambitious global effort to end the age of plastic by 2024 in a legally binding document.</p>
<p>Our latest win involves Costco Wholesale*, one of the largest retailers in the world. Our shareholder advocates convinced Costco to expand its plastics reduction efforts. The company committed to increased plastic footprint disclosures and creating a 5-year plastic action plan. This victory, along with the policies we have secured from 12 other companies including Keurig Dr Pepper*, will help keep plastic out of our oceans and protect wildlife</p>

<p>Native bees will be less likely to encounter deadly pesticides thanks to new state laws spearheaded by Environment Colorado and Environment California. Together with many allies, they also secured new protections for the Boundary Waters (Minnesota), Bristol Bay (Alaska), Chaco Canyon (New Mexico) and the Grand Canyon region (Arizona). In November, voters approved an Environment Texas-backed $1 billion bond <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/articles/texans-vote-yes-on-1-billion-for-state-parks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to fund the largest expansion of parks in the state history</a>.</p>
<p><strong style="background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--base); color: var(--wp--preset--color--contrast); font-family: var(--wp--preset--font-family--system-font); font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--medium);">4. Won Right to Repair victories for Chromebook users and farmers</strong></p>
<p>Green Century and nonprofit owner, Colorado Public Interest Research Group (CoPIRG) worked together on an effort that led to the Centennial State becoming the first in the nation ensuring farmers can fix their tractors and other equipment.</p>
<p>This victory builds on our earlier engagements with Deere &amp; Company*, the manufacturer of the iconic John Deere tractor and a wide array of other agriculture equipment, to reverse its opposition to the right-to-repair movement. Additionally, Green Century and CoPIRG together called on Google* to extend<a href="https://pirg.org/colorado/articles/when-will-my-chromebook-expire-why-computers-should-be-designed-to-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> software on Chromebooks used by school districts and students across the nation</a>. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/googles-chromebook-extension-is-a-win-in-the-fight-against-e-waste/">Green Century engagement</a> led to the company announcing plans to continue software updates for Chromebooks for up to 10 years starting in 2024. This win means millions of serviceable laptops continued to be used instead of ending up in landfills.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Led the Fossil Fuel Free Movement</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-18796 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FFF-front-page-image-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Green Century became one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds in 2014 and this April we updated our popular <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide-sign-up/">Fossil Fuel Free Investing Guide,</a> co-authored this year with <a href="https://www.greenamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green America.</a>  Get your free copy and listen to our webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA_JM7-KayU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Greening Your Investments</em></a> if you or your family members are interested in joining thousands of individuals and institutions, including Harvard University and the Church of England, avoid the coal, oil and gas industry in your investments.</p>
<p><em>“We must stop climate change. And we can if we used the tactics that worked in South Africa against the worst carbon emitters.” </em></p>
<p><em>— The late Archbishop of South Africa, Desmond Tuto</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Green Century’s president named to prestigious Barron’s List</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In April, I had the honor of being named to Barron’s <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-funds-president-named-to-prestigious-barrons-list/">100 Most Influential Women in U.S. Finance</a>, joining the ranks of prominent women including Treasury Secretary Janice Yellen and female leaders at the Federal Reserve, International Money Fund, Alphabet, and other places. As one of the very few women recognized in the socially and environmentally responsible investing field, I am heartened that our role in championing values-aligned investing and exposing greenwashing was recognized. We’re proud to help people understand the significant differences between investing strategies and shareholder engagement that sets Green Century apart from others.</p>

<li><strong> We appreciate investors – like you!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our top highlight is our supportive Green Century Funds investors. Our efforts to hold corporations accountable would not have happened without you.</p>
