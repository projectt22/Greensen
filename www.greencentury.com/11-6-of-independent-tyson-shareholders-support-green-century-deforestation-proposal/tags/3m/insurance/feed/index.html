<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 14.8% of votes cast on Wednesday supported a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the insurer Markel Group to disclose the climate emissions from its underwriting, investing and insuring activities. The Virginia-based company has grown from <a href="https://www.mklgroup.com/who-we-are/our-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering small buses</a> to insuring a range of properties from boats to <a href="https://www.markel.com/international/london/energy/downstream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oil refineries</a> over its 95 years of operation.  </p>



<p>“Insurers’ pursuit of short-term profits from fossil fuels guarantees long-term environmental and financial costs,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.&nbsp;</strong> “It makes no sense for any business to willingly and knowingly contribute to something &#8212; in this case, climate change &#8212; that causes such large payouts. Investors deserve to know how Markel’s emissions drive the climate risks its business is losing money from.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/is-climate-change-increasing-the-risk-of-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural disasters increase</a> in frequency and severity due to climate change, so do the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulties insurers face in pricing risk</a> and recovering losses from climate disasters. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2023 <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded $100 billion</a> for the fourth consecutive year and the Swiss Re Group projects they could <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double within the next ten years</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impacts of increasing emissions extend to homeowners as well. Insurers are increasingly abandoning areas vulnerable to climate change-fueled severe weather by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/18/homeowners-insurance-california-florida-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to renew policies</a> at the end of their term. A congressional investigation revealed that climate change has spurred <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiking non-renewal rates</a> by insurers and <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher premiums</a> for customers. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more th</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 counties</a> across the United States, the rate of non-renewal has tripled or more since 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Markel is quiet on climate impact&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a professed <a href="https://www.markel.com/about-us/company-responsibility#5927E3E9394A46A29A73467F1A9B4CA4-tab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to environmental stewardship</a>, Markel does not report any of its climate emissions or publish an annual sustainability report. This places the company far behind competitors including <a href="https://asset.trvstatic.com/download/assets/Travelers_TCFDReport2023.pdf/93114e88b97011efa5e28e42e80f1a8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travelers</a>* and <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIG</a>, both of which disclose their operational emissions and are expanding efforts to measure the emissions associated with their investments. Markel is also out of step with the vast majority of other companies in the Russell 1000 index – which represents the biggest companies in the U.S. – 93% of which published a <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/nc/storage/press-releases/article/ga-institutes-research-shows-2023-sustainability-reporting-at-record-levels-as-us-public-compani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustainability report in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, investors and consumers will foot the bill for Markel’s lack of transparency and failure to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Understanding the scope of Markel’s unwriting, investing and insuring of fossil fuels is the first step in responding to these risks to both pocketbooks and the planet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 16, 2025</strong> – Chubb’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century° shareholder proposal calling for the company to disclose the climate emissions associated with its investing, underwriting and insuring activities. 13.9% of shareholders cast their votes in favor of the proposal. Chubb is one of the<a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/chubb/67002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> largest publicly traded property and casualty insurers</a>, operating in 55 countries across the globe.</p>



<p>“Investors deserve to know how Chubb’s emissions are driving the climate risks disrupting its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “It’s absurd for Chubb to underwrite activities that cause climate change and then turn around and pay for the claims and payouts caused by these activities.”</p>



<p><a></a>As climate change intensifies, <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/01/09/807524.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurers are increasingly on the hook</a> after more frequent and severe natural disasters. At the same time, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-01-31/insurance-companies-fossil-fuel-industry-eaton-palisades-fire-essential-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many continue to insure fossil fuel projects</a> that exacerbate the losses from those events. Many major insurance companies such as <a href="https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allianz</a> and <a href="https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:52d75760-2c43-4d96-be2f-0514382ac51a/2023-sustainability-report-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Re</a>* have begun disclosing the emissions associated with their fossil fuel clients, increasing transparency on their role in intensifying the climate crisis.</p>



<p><strong>Chubb insures climate risks</strong></p>



<p>Last year’s wildfires in Los Angeles and destructive hurricane season in the Atlantic have sparked concern about a climate-driven insurance crisis. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 had the most billion-dollar climate-related disasters</a> in one year. Insurance companies are increasingly unable to withstand growing losses without raising prices or reducing coverage in high-risk areas.</p>



<p>Chubb has noticed the impact of climate change on its bottom line. Following an estimated <a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/chubb-estimates-1-5bn-loss-from-la-wildfires-amid-reduced-california-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 billion dollars in losses</a> from the 2024 California fires, Chubb’s Chief Executive Evan Greenberg warned: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pricier-insurance-makes-sense-as-climate-risk-grows-chubb-ceo-says-5e5d53b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The cost of climate change, to state the obvious: Going up.”</a></p>



<p>“The companies that are supposed to protect us from the consequences of climate change are also fueling its disastrous effects,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Chubb reporting the emissions from its underwriting, investing, and insuring would demonstrate accountability and an intent to reduce its climate impact.”</p>

<p>In the face of new attacks on our national environmental laws to protect the air, water and land we cherish, we sometimes feel powerless.</p>



<p>But I know that the best way to handle this challenge is to take all the individual and collective actions that we can. That’s why we will be showcasing ways for you to protect people and the planet in the months to come. With our non-proﬁt owners, we will be offering virtual and hands-on ways to protect pollinators, reduce plastic waste and conserve tropical rainforests.</p>

With every investment, you send a message that you won’t support companies that are contributing to wrecking the environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life as a shareholder advocate can be unpredictable – some of my work has a consistent flow, but I certainly wasn’t expecting an impromptu call from a CEO.</p>
<p>Green Century<em>°</em> shareholder advocates often use the stakes in different companies on behalf of Green Century Funds, as a way of influencing management decisions on deforestation, carbon emissions, climate change, single-use plastic reductions and other issues with environmental impacts. I work on our insurance campaign pressing insurance companies to stop offering coverage for new fossil fuel projects. Not surprisingly, these insurers are not interested in changing their insurance strategies.</p>
<p>During the year, shareholder advocates research the environmental risks that companies are exposed to or, worse yet, they create. And, we then communicate with companies by writing, calls, and face-to-face dialogue. When we can’t agree on a course of action, we present our concerns to fellow shareholders at companies’ annual meetings.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the Travelers’* annual meeting in Hartford, CT. After I presented Green Century’s Funds’ shareholder proposal, I went on a treasure hunt to meet the company’s board of directors and CEO, Alan Schnitzer. Security guards were blocking my path to the board, but I managed to meet three directors. I was thrilled.</p>
<p>I also asked to speak to Travelers’ CEO Alan Schnitzer, but he was busy. Then something special happened. As I reached my car to go home, Alan Schnitzer called me. I was sure it was a prank. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>We exchanged pleasantries, but the conversation steered toward Green Century Funds’ shareholder proposal. He wasn’t happy with it. We had to agree to disagree on whether insuring new fossil fuel projects was the right thing to do. Spoiler alert – I didn’t think it was. I still don’t.</p>
<p>A call from a CEO is a rare occurrence, and it signaled to me that Green Century Funds’ advocacy efforts were hitting their mark. However, I give a lot of credit to Travelers’ CEO for taking the time to call and listen to my concerns.</p>
<p>Being tenacious, and professionally polite, can pay big dividends. Further, the effort to meet board members helped humanize the relationship between Green Century Funds and Travelers. I’ll meet with Travelers again later this year, but now we have a stronger rapport.</p>
<p>It’s a privilege to be a shareholder advocate working on the toughest environmental challenges the world faces. Encounters with CEOs can result in better connections with corporate management. We always look for ways to collaborate, so we welcome phone calls from CEOs. Let’s work on solutions together.</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>
<p>Warmly, Andrea</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 26, 2023</strong> – – Shareholders showed less support for a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">Green Century° proposal</a> that asked Travelers to establish a deadline for phasing out underwriting new fossil fuel projects. Votes cast in favor reached <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000086312/000110465923064998/tm2316995d1_8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.8%</a>, less than the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/votes-on-green-century-proposal-at-travelers-concludes-series-of-filings-at-major-insurers/">2022 vote outcome of 13.2%</a> for a similar Green Century proposal. Green Century filed the same proposal seeking underwriting restrictions on fossil fuel projects at a peer company, The Hartford*, earning 8.8% of the vote on May 17th.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals were prompted by concerns that Travelers’ underwriting strategies were not clearly aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Global climate and energy experts at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  and the International Energy Agency (IEA) assert that expanding fossil fuel supply will likely push the world beyond the recommended limit of a 1.5°C temperature rise. The IPCC reports explicitly that exceeding the 1.5°C limit will likely result in dangerous physical risks, and, in some cases, irreversible natural resource damage.</p>
<p>While U.S. insurers, <a href="https://about.chubb.com/citizenship/environment/coal-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chubb*</a> and <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2019/The-Hartford-Announces-Its-Policy-On-Insuring-Investing-In-Coal-Tar-Sands/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hartford</a>, announced partial underwriting exclusions on insuring thermal coal mining and coal plant construction and operation in 2019, it took Travelers an extra two years to make a <a href="https://sustainability.travelers.com/iw-documents/sustainability/coal-tar-sands-policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar commitment</a>. Additionally, it has yet to extend its exclusions to contractors, equipment or projects that support the development of new oil and gas wells, pipelines, and related fossil fuel infrastructure, even as  climate experts declare the use of fossil fuels must dramatically decline.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said: </strong></p>
<p>“Regardless of the vote, it&#8217;s important to keep this issue front and center for Travelers. We see no reason why it should enable new oil and gas supply in the face of the dire need to transition to a low-carbon economy.  To its credit, Travelers has already started down the right path by underwriting new renewable energy projects, including offshore wind construction. However, it still needs to detour from the path of insuring the expansion of fossil fuels.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Covering the liability and casualty risks for owners, contractors, and equipment that will allow new methane gas, a.ka. “natural” gas, to flow or new oil for gasoline will only lock us into carbon emissions for years to come. In my view, Travelers has a duty not only to its shareholders, but to stakeholders in general, to pivot from an industry that’s contributed the most to climate change.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2023</strong> – The Hartford announced the vote results on Friday for a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">Green Century° proposal</a> asking the company to establish a deadline for phasing out underwriting new fossil fuel projects. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/874766/000087476623000076/hig-20230517.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Votes cast in favor reached 8.8%</a>, the same as the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb/">2022 vote outcome of 8.8%</a> for a similar Green Century proposal. Green Century filed the same proposal seeking underwriting restrictions on fossil fuel projects at peer company, Travelers, whose annual meeting of shareholders will be held on May 24th.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals were prompted by reports authored by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  and the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicating how expanding fossil fuel supply is likely to push the world beyond the recommended limit of a 1.5°C temperature rise. The IPCC explicitly reports that exceeding the 1.5°C limit will likely result in dangerous physical risks, and, in some cases, irreversible natural resource damage.</p>
<p>While The Hartford did adopt partial underwriting exclusions for insuring thermal coal mining, coal plant construction and operation, and tar sands-related risks in 2019, it hasn’t extended its exclusions beyond the most heavily-polluting fuels &#8211; even when  climate experts say use of fossil fuels must dramatically decline. In 2022, the company adopted a goal to reach <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2022/The-Hartford-Announces-Goal-Of-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-For-All-Operations-By-2050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net-zero emissions by 2050</a>, but has yet to launch new initiatives in support of its goal.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said: </strong></p>
<p>“Regardless of the vote outcome, Green Century will continue to press The Hartford to fully address its climate risk. Despite its existing exclusions and its net-zero by 2050 goal, we’d like to see The Hartford extend its underwriting exclusions to other dirty fossil fuels, including new oil and gas projects. Insurance companies have a critical role to play in steering us toward a low-carbon economy, but supporting new oil and gas wells, pipelines, and transportation infrastructure will likely lock us into carbon emissions that we simply can’t afford.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Covering the liability and casualty risks of new oil and gas projects is antithetical to protecting the rest of The Hartford’s clients from climate risk. In light of the company’s net-zero goal, I believe Green Century Funds’ proposal is a reasonable request to phase out underwriting new risks for an industry that’s contributed the most to climate change.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 15, 2023</strong> – Green Century’s° <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">shareholder proposals</a> filed with The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and The Travelers Companies, Inc. are going to a vote at the companies’ annual general meetings on May 17<sup>th</sup> and May 24<sup>th</sup>, respectively. Green Century filed the proposals in December requesting that the companies phase out underwriting new fossil fuel projects in line with the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit global warming to 1.5℃ over pre-industrial temperatures.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals raise concerns that <a href="https://www.thehartford.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hartford</a> and <a href="https://www.travelers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travelers</a> are exposed to climate risk. Both companies underwrite policies meant to protect customers’ homes and businesses from the impacts of climate-driven catastrophes while simultaneously underwriting policies for the fossil fuel industry, whose emissions amplify the effects of those catastrophes.</p>
<p>“Insurers seem to think developing more gas and oil will somehow ease us into a clean energy transition, but developing new wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure is fundamentally incompatible with protecting people and the planet,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “Insurance should be about protection, not enabling systemic threats like climate change.”</p>
<p><strong>Net-zero goals and insuring new renewables projects are not enough</strong></p>
<p>While both The Hartford and Travelers have adopted partial underwriting exclusions on insuring thermal coal mining, coal plant construction and operation, and tar sands-related risks, neither company has agreed to limit underwriting new oil and gas projects, even in ecologically-sensitive areas like the Arctic. U.S. insurer Chubb*, the largest publicly-traded commercial property and casualty insurer in the world, <a href="https://news.chubb.com/2023-03-22-Chubb-Announces-New-Climate-and-Conservation-Focused-Underwriting-Standards-for-Oil-and-Gas-Extraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March that it will no longer underwrite oil and gas extraction projects in government-protected conservation areas and that it will press existing clients to cut methane leaks and emissions from flaring.</p>
<p>Although The Hartford set a <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2022/The-Hartford-Announces-Goal-Of-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-For-All-Operations-By-2050/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal</a> to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across its full range of operations, the company has not announced plans to address how its underwriting strategies support its net-zero commitment. Travelers has neither set a net-zero goal nor has it addressed the incongruency of insuring fossil fuel development with protecting its customers from severe weather enhanced by a warming climate.</p>
<p>“Both The Hartford and Travelers are insuring new renewable energy projects, and we applaud that,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “But developing more renewables is only half the answer. Climate experts tell us that the other half is giving up extracting and burning even more oil and gas. For an industry that relies on science, I hope insurers will extract new oil and gas projects from their underwriting portfolios.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, May 2, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gcchubb032723-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In March giving Chubb Limited permission to block Green Century Funds’ </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shareholder proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal requests Chubb adopt a policy for the time-bound phase out of underwriting new coal, oil, and gas projects. Green Century</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed a similar proposal in 2022, asking for an immediate cessation of underwriting new projects. Chubb challenged last year’s proposal, but, at that time, the SEC ruled the proposal could appear on Chubb’s 2022 ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chubb is the largest publicly-traded property and casualty insurance company and is actively involved in underwriting oil and gas project risks. For example, Chubb has previously underwritten policies for controversial fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Trans Mountain pipeline. A 2022 report exposed Chubb as a major underwriter of liability and transportation risks for offshore oil drilling operations for Petrobras – Brazil’s national oil company – which has the </span><a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fifth largest oil and gas expansion plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any oil and gas company in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re disappointed that Chubb did not want its shareholders to vote on this issue and that the SEC supported Chubb’s argument, claiming that our proposal requires shareholders to ‘probe too deeply’ into Chubb’s core business. We think shareholders understand insurance is essential for coal, oil and gas companies, and many do not believe increasingly expensive drilling and its associated emissions are good for business,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve asked Chubb to phase out insurance for new projects that will likely create decades of greenhouse gas  emissions. It’s hard to square how Chubb enables carbon pollution while simultaneously issuing policies to protect people’s homes and businesses from the impacts of climate change.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the SEC’s ruling, Chubb had announced </span><a href="https://about.chubb.com/#:~:text=Chubb%20is%20the%20world&#039;s%20largest,health%20insurance%2C%20reinsurance%20and%20life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new underwriting criteria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for oil and gas extraction projects requiring existing clients to reduce methane emissions. Additionally, Chubb said it would no longer provide coverage for oil and gas projects in state- or nationally-designated protected areas and in certain other conservation areas. Green Century Funds welcomed action but also </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-chubb-announces-new-policy-to-restrict-its-underwriting-of-oil-and-gas-sector-green-century-seeks-details-on-how-effectively-it-will-reduce-carbon-emissions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critiqued the new policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicating that its potential for reducing greenhouse emissions was unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For two years, we have been pressing Chubb to uphold its duty to protect its shareholders and customers from climate risk,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We believe helping the fossil fuel industry is completely contrary to its fiduciary and prudential responsibilities. These actions aid and abet an industry that has done the most to contribute to a warming planet. Insurers like Chubb have to show more leadership because they are on the front lines of experiencing climate risk.”</span></p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813<br />
Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</p>
<p><strong>Boston, March 22, 2023</strong> – The insurance company Chubb Limited announced a <a href="https://news.chubb.com/2023-03-22-Chubb-Announces-New-Climate-and-Conservation-Focused-Underwriting-Standards-for-Oil-and-Gas-Extraction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new policy</a> Wednesday aimed at reducing methane emissions released by its oil and gas clients’ operations. Chubb declared it will no longer cover oil and gas projects in government-protected conservation areas found in the <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Database on Protected Areas</a>.</p>
<p>Chubb was the <a href="https://news.chubb.com/2019-07-01-Chubb-Announces-New-Policy-on-Coal-Underwriting-and-Investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first U.S. insurer</a> to adopt any restrictions on underwriting new coal mining, new coal plant construction and operation, and new risks for utilities burning coal. In 2022, Chubb announced it would no longer offer coverage for oil sands projects, either. It is now the first U.S. insurer to announce underwriting restrictions on extraction from conservation areas. In addition, Chubb says it plans to work with oil and gas clients on improving methane leak detection, eliminating non-emergency venting of methane, and reducing emissions from flaring.</p>
<p>“We welcome any new policy that will effectively cut emissions in line with what experts tell us we need to do to prevent the worst impacts of climate change,” said Green Century Funds President, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, “But &#8212; and there’s a big but &#8212; it’s not clear whether Chubb’s new policy aligns its entire book of business with a 1.5 degrees Celsius scenario. We need to see more details to know whether this is an impactful policy or simply a diversion from our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">shareholder proposal</a>, so we invite Chubb to further explain its new policy.”</p>
<p>Green Century Funds has negotiated with Chubb over the past two years, urging the company to stop underwriting new fossil fuel projects in alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Each year, Green Century has filed a shareholder proposal asking Chubb to commit to phase out underwriting new coal, oil and gas projects. The 2022 proposal received <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/chubb-tries-to-block-green-century-shareholder-proposal-for-second-year-in-a-row/">19.4% of the vote</a>, a high enough percentage that Green Century could file again this year. Chubb has again appealed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, asking it to block Green Century’s proposal from appearing on this year’s proxy ballot.</p>
<p>“Despite Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurer-chubb-demands-energy-producers-cut-methane-emissions-for-coverage-52251222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments</a> that its new policy is science-based, it’s unclear if or how the plan matches up with this fact: Global emissions need to drop nearly <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50% by 2030</a> to avoid the worst effects of climate change,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE">Andrea Ranger</a>. “Our shareholder proposal asks Chubb to take a concrete step forward to phase out underwriting new fossil fuel projects. Let me be clear: This does not rule out underwriting <em>existing</em> companies, projects or operations. Some energy companies may actually be developing low-carbon projects and Chubb <em>should</em> underwrite those risks. Nevertheless, underwriting new oil and gas supply amplifies medium- and long-term climate risk, which doesn’t add shareholder value.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such cri</em><em>teria.</em></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, mmorgenstein@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 22, 2023</strong> &#8211; In response to Green Century<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i> re-filing of a shareholder proposal in December, Chubb Limited, the world’s largest commercial property and casualty insurer, has once again asked the SEC for permission to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block the proposal</a> from its proxy ballot. In 2022, Green Century filed a virtually identical <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">proposal</a> asking the company to stop underwriting new coal, oil and methane gas projects. The SEC denied Chubb’s request. Subsequently, the proposal went to a vote at Chubb’s 2022 annual general meeting and garnered the support of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb/">19.4% of the shareholder votes cast</a>.</p>
<p>Like most U.S. property and casualty insurers, Chubb lags behind its European peers in adopting meaningful exclusions. Despite the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and constraints on fossil fuel supply,<a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/worlds-largest-reinsurer-announces-major-new-oil-and-gas-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">  </a>a number of European property and casualty insurers now exclude more oil and methane gas development in their fossil fuel underwriting.  By contrast, in January 2022, a global NGO insurance campaign identified Chubb as a major underwriter of South American offshore oil and gas drilling projects, providing Brazil’s national oil company coverage for 60% of its general civil liability and 50% of its transport-related risks. This state-owned Brazilian company has the fifth-largest documented oil and gas expansion plans of any oil and gas company in the world.</p>
<p>“It boggles the mind to think that an insurance company would willingly create risk for itself and its shareholders by supporting new fossil fuel supply,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “We have to transition away from fuels that create carbon pollution and drive global warming. And let me be clear: We’re not asking Chubb to summarily cancel existing contracts. We’re asking Chubb to be more forward-thinking about a slice of its business and phase out of underwriting new fossil fuel projects. It’s a low bar to clear considering the existential risk of climate change.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chubb argued to the SEC</a> that Green Century’s proposal should be excluded because it probes too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.</p>
<p>“Chubb’s argument seems to underestimate the intelligence of its shareholders,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “I’m sure many are able to come to the fairly obvious conclusion that insurance policies enabling new coal, oil and gas supplies are fueling increasingly severe climate change impacts. It’s not rocket science.”</p>
