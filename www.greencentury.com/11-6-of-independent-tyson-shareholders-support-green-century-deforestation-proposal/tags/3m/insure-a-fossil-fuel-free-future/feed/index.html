<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 14.8% of votes cast on Wednesday supported a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the insurer Markel Group to disclose the climate emissions from its underwriting, investing and insuring activities. The Virginia-based company has grown from <a href="https://www.mklgroup.com/who-we-are/our-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering small buses</a> to insuring a range of properties from boats to <a href="https://www.markel.com/international/london/energy/downstream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oil refineries</a> over its 95 years of operation.  </p>



<p>“Insurers’ pursuit of short-term profits from fossil fuels guarantees long-term environmental and financial costs,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.&nbsp;</strong> “It makes no sense for any business to willingly and knowingly contribute to something &#8212; in this case, climate change &#8212; that causes such large payouts. Investors deserve to know how Markel’s emissions drive the climate risks its business is losing money from.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/is-climate-change-increasing-the-risk-of-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural disasters increase</a> in frequency and severity due to climate change, so do the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulties insurers face in pricing risk</a> and recovering losses from climate disasters. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2023 <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded $100 billion</a> for the fourth consecutive year and the Swiss Re Group projects they could <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double within the next ten years</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impacts of increasing emissions extend to homeowners as well. Insurers are increasingly abandoning areas vulnerable to climate change-fueled severe weather by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/18/homeowners-insurance-california-florida-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to renew policies</a> at the end of their term. A congressional investigation revealed that climate change has spurred <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiking non-renewal rates</a> by insurers and <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher premiums</a> for customers. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more th</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 counties</a> across the United States, the rate of non-renewal has tripled or more since 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Markel is quiet on climate impact&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a professed <a href="https://www.markel.com/about-us/company-responsibility#5927E3E9394A46A29A73467F1A9B4CA4-tab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to environmental stewardship</a>, Markel does not report any of its climate emissions or publish an annual sustainability report. This places the company far behind competitors including <a href="https://asset.trvstatic.com/download/assets/Travelers_TCFDReport2023.pdf/93114e88b97011efa5e28e42e80f1a8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travelers</a>* and <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIG</a>, both of which disclose their operational emissions and are expanding efforts to measure the emissions associated with their investments. Markel is also out of step with the vast majority of other companies in the Russell 1000 index – which represents the biggest companies in the U.S. – 93% of which published a <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/nc/storage/press-releases/article/ga-institutes-research-shows-2023-sustainability-reporting-at-record-levels-as-us-public-compani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustainability report in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, investors and consumers will foot the bill for Markel’s lack of transparency and failure to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Understanding the scope of Markel’s unwriting, investing and insuring of fossil fuels is the first step in responding to these risks to both pocketbooks and the planet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2022 – </strong>Voting results are in for two Green Century<em>°</em> shareholder proposals filed with The Hartford and Chubb insurance companies. Green Century filed virtually the same proposal with each company asking them to abide by climate science and stop underwriting fossil fuel expansion. Through filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the companies disclosed that 8.8% and 19.4% of votes cast, respectively, were in favor of the proposal. </p>



<p>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich reacted to the news by saying, “We’re pleased with the vote on the first year of these proposals, which signals that shareholders understand that insuring new fossil fuel development may be bad for business. We believe that underwriting more development of coal, oil and gas &#8212; products whose emissions drive climate change &#8212; while simultaneously collecting premiums from customers who seek protection from climate change, is fundamentally incompatible.”</p>



<p>As of 2020, Chubb was the largest commercial property and casualty insurer in the world; The Hartford ranked 8th. Both are believed to offer significant coverage to the fossil fuel industry, and a recent publication entitled, <a href="https://us.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/02/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fueling Climate Change The Insurers Behind Brazil’s Offshore Oil Expansion</a>, reports that Chubb underwrites policies for Brazil’s national oil company, which has the fifth-largest expansion plans of any oil and gas company in the world.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Green Century’s groundbreaking proposals push insurers to change</h2>



<p>Green Century’s groundbreaking proposals ask Chubb and The Hartford to align their underwriting policies with the International Energy Agency’s report, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap</em></a><em>.</em> The Roadmap incorporates the recommendation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change. In addition, the Roadmap also articulates that new fossil fuel development is incompatible with maintaining the 1.5 degree Celsius limit on temperature increase. </p>



<p>“Because insurance companies are at the forefront of managing risk, helping companies whose products are filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases makes no sense,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “We recognize that our proposal is breaking ground by asking for direct changes to Chubb’s and The Hartford’s underwriting strategies for coal, oil and gas projects, and we’re not deterred by the vote result. We’ll continue to engage Chubb and The Hartford and push for a transition away from underwriting fossil fuel expansion. If necessary, we’ll bring the issue in front of shareholders again.”</p>
