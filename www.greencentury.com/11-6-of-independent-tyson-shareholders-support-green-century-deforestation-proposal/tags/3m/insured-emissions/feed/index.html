<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 14.8% of votes cast on Wednesday supported a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the insurer Markel Group to disclose the climate emissions from its underwriting, investing and insuring activities. The Virginia-based company has grown from <a href="https://www.mklgroup.com/who-we-are/our-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering small buses</a> to insuring a range of properties from boats to <a href="https://www.markel.com/international/london/energy/downstream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oil refineries</a> over its 95 years of operation.  </p>



<p>“Insurers’ pursuit of short-term profits from fossil fuels guarantees long-term environmental and financial costs,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.&nbsp;</strong> “It makes no sense for any business to willingly and knowingly contribute to something &#8212; in this case, climate change &#8212; that causes such large payouts. Investors deserve to know how Markel’s emissions drive the climate risks its business is losing money from.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/is-climate-change-increasing-the-risk-of-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">natural disasters increase</a> in frequency and severity due to climate change, so do the <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulties insurers face in pricing risk</a> and recovering losses from climate disasters. Global insured losses from natural catastrophes in 2023 <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded $100 billion</a> for the fourth consecutive year and the Swiss Re Group projects they could <a href="https://www.swissre.com/press-release/New-record-of-142-natural-catastrophes-accumulates-to-USD-108-billion-insured-losses-in-2023-finds-Swiss-Re-Institute/a2512914-6d3a-492e-a190-aac37feca15b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double within the next ten years</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impacts of increasing emissions extend to homeowners as well. Insurers are increasingly abandoning areas vulnerable to climate change-fueled severe weather by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/18/homeowners-insurance-california-florida-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to renew policies</a> at the end of their term. A congressional investigation revealed that climate change has spurred <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spiking non-renewal rates</a> by insurers and <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/next_to_fall_the_climate-driven_insurance_crisis_is_here__and_getting_worse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher premiums</a> for customers. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more th</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/12/18/climate/insurance-non-renewal-climate-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 counties</a> across the United States, the rate of non-renewal has tripled or more since 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Markel is quiet on climate impact&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite a professed <a href="https://www.markel.com/about-us/company-responsibility#5927E3E9394A46A29A73467F1A9B4CA4-tab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to environmental stewardship</a>, Markel does not report any of its climate emissions or publish an annual sustainability report. This places the company far behind competitors including <a href="https://asset.trvstatic.com/download/assets/Travelers_TCFDReport2023.pdf/93114e88b97011efa5e28e42e80f1a8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Travelers</a>* and <a href="https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-sustainability-report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIG</a>, both of which disclose their operational emissions and are expanding efforts to measure the emissions associated with their investments. Markel is also out of step with the vast majority of other companies in the Russell 1000 index – which represents the biggest companies in the U.S. – 93% of which published a <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/nc/storage/press-releases/article/ga-institutes-research-shows-2023-sustainability-reporting-at-record-levels-as-us-public-compani/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustainability report in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ultimately, investors and consumers will foot the bill for Markel’s lack of transparency and failure to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Understanding the scope of Markel’s unwriting, investing and insuring of fossil fuels is the first step in responding to these risks to both pocketbooks and the planet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>Boston, May 17, 2024</strong>  – Chubb* investors cast 28% of votes in favor of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896159/000110465924041810/tm2327870d7_def14a.htm#tAI11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shareholder proposal</a> filed by Green Century<em>°</em> and the As You Sow Foundation Fund asking the company to disclose climate emissions associated with its insurance and investment activities.</p>
<p>For the past two years, Chubb has fought similar resolutions that also sought comprehensive and detailed emissions reporting.</p>
<p>Chubb is the largest publicly-traded commercial property and casualty insurance company in the world. The company insures companies that drill for oil and gas, operate oil pipelines, and build liquified natural gas terminals, including in <a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/risk-exposure-the-insurers-backing-the-lng-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">communities on the Gulf Coast of the United States</a>. Chubb had previously insured the infamous <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trans Mountain tar sands pipeline in Canada,</a> which transports crude oil and tar sands oil from landlocked Alberta to Canada’s Pacific Coast. Producing tar sands fuel is <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_shale_and_tar_sands/#:~:text=As%20with%20oil%20shale%2C%20once,usable%20as%20a%20fuel%20source.&amp;text=Producing%20oil%20from%20shale%20or,dirtier%20than%20the%20dirtiest%20coal." target="_blank" rel="noopener">even dirtier than coal</a>.</p>
<p>“At a time when the heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes related to climate change are increasing, Chubb, at the very least, should keep investors informed about the risks they face from the emissions its insurance and investments enable,&#8221; said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “If a global insurance company with the sharpest actuaries can’t begin to measure and report this data, then that should worry all of us.”</p>
<p><strong>Chubb Conflicted About Climate Change</strong></p>
<p>Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg has stressed that Chubb works to support industries that either help business and individuals reduce their carbon footprints or to create new technologies that produce carbon-free energy. In the company&#8217;s 2023 annual report, Chubb acknowledged that climate change-fueled severe weather and natural catastrophes may have challenged its profitability. Chubb also made headlines in late 2021, when it decided to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wildfire-risk-in-california-drives-insurers-to-pull-policies-for-pricey-homes-11642593601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pull homeowners insurance coverage</a> in wildfire prone areas of California.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Chubb ranks <a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/IOF-2023-Scorecard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4<sup>th</sup> on the Insure Our Future’s 2022 list of top fossil fuel insurers in the world,</a> and is a <a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key insurer of Brazil’s national oil company</a>, which directs exploratory and ongoing drilling in some of the world’s most sensitive ecological sites around the Great Amazon Reef and along Brazil’s coastline.</p>
<p>“As investors, we know there are short-term rewards for providing insurance to fossil fuel interests,” commented Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “However, the long-term consequences of short-term decisions is what we’re concerned about. Climate change has a very long tail, and we want insurers to prevent, not worsen, this looming threat.”</p>
