<p>In the face of new attacks on our national environmental laws to protect the air, water and land we cherish, we sometimes feel powerless.</p>



<p>But I know that the best way to handle this challenge is to take all the individual and collective actions that we can. That’s why we will be showcasing ways for you to protect people and the planet in the months to come. With our non-proﬁt owners, we will be offering virtual and hands-on ways to protect pollinators, reduce plastic waste and conserve tropical rainforests.</p>



<p>Where you invest your future savings can make an impact. You can begin right now by starting or adding to your <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century Funds</a> investment. You <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/ira-information/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-SA-Season-Highlights-3.31.24-1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">can open or contribute to an IRA</a>, start an educational savings plan for a relative or read our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fossil Fuel Free Investing Guide</a> to get started. With every investment, you send a message that you won’t support companies that are contributing to wrecking the environment.</p>



<p>We can choose investments that avoid industries that literally fuel climate change and enrich oil, gas and insurance executives or we can put our money where it can beneﬁt the planet. We have choices and the combined power of our investments.</p>



<p>Will you join the thousands of Americans who are sending a message with their investments?</p>



<p>Green Century°, for more than three decades, has selected companies in its three mutual funds that have track records of acting responsibly for our environment. We are vigilant in ensuring these companies steward our planet, and our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/our-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">award-winning advocates </a>leverage the power as shareholders to hold companies accountable to their pledges.</p>



<p><em>A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>



<p>When we act with others, we can make a difference. Never has there been a moment of greater urgency. Let’s do this together.</p>
