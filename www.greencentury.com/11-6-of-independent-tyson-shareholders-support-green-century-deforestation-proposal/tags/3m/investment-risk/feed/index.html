					<p><b>(BOSTON) </b>Green Century° and Hilton Worldwide Holdings* reached a multi-year agreement for the major hotel chain to release an assessment of its single-use plastic by 2025 and set a plastic reduction goal by 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after competitors <a id="OWA8d5a00d0-04f6-7e87-8aae-8cc5e507a461" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/marriott-international-to-measure-cut-plastic-waste/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Marriott</a> and <a id="OWA7c7ba5ad-28f6-0034-d79a-25a6200cdd3c" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/choice-hotels-takes-first-step-in-tackling-plastic-pollution/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Choice Hotels</a> also agreed to measure and reduce single-use plastic, following agreements with Green Century.</p>
<p>“Neither Hilton nor its investors want to be stuck holding the bill for the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastic,” said <a id="OWA3a8141b8-fcc4-00d3-cbdf-c68eb0dca6d2" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds. “We applaud Hilton for committing to reduce its contribution to the plastic pollution crisis.”</p>
<h3><b>Plastic Pollution Crisis Continues to Grow</b></h3>
<p>Plastic pollution has been doubling every <a id="LPlnk561662" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six years</a>. Plastics don’t degrade, but break into small pieces called microplastics, which impact oceans, soil, the atmosphere, and human health.</p>
<p>“Consumers learn more everyday about the serious issues with plastic,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Companies need a strategy for the future beyond single-use plastic.”</p>
<p>Hilton, like its competitors, provides single-use plastic in its rooms, guest common spaces, and food service locations.</p>
<p>While the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastic have long alarmed scientists, the scale of crisis is just starting to be better understood by consumers.</p>
<p>According to a recent study, <a id="LPlnk643534" title="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seventy-five percent of Americans</a> want to see the private-sector offer plastic free options, and 72% agree that companies should stop producing and using so much single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Recycling may not be the solution it once promised. Only <a id="LPlnk" title="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastics</a> have been recycled, and many plastics aren&#8217;t recyclable at all, despite sporting the famous chasing arrows symbols.</p>
<p>Even plastics that are commonly recyclable, like #1 PET, <a id="LPlnk864054" title="https://pirg.org/articles/frequently-asked-questions-about-recycling-plastics/" href="https://pirg.org/articles/frequently-asked-questions-about-recycling-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pose significant challenges</a>. Color, size, shape, chemical additives, and downcycling prevent many plastics from being turned into new products.</p>
