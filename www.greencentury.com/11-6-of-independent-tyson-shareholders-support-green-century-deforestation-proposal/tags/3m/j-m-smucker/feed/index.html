<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2025</strong> – J.M. Smucker*, parent company of Folgers, Café Bustelo and Dunkin’ at Home coffee products, has agreed to review its forest protection policies with an ambition of eventually sourcing all of its ingredients without any collateral deforestation. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century Capital Management.</p>



<p>“As investors, we encourage companies to reduce their material risks and improve their environmental impact,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Smuckers’ will follow up its research swiftly with a commitment to source coffee and other ingredients from verified deforestation-free sources.”</p>



<p>J.M. Smucker is the largest seller of at-home coffee in the <a href="https://www.jmsmucker.com/brands-you-love/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a>. It also produces its namesake jellies, Hostess Twinkies, Milk Bone dog biscuits, and a wide range of other popular <a href="https://www.jmsmucker.com/brands-you-love" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snack and pet foods</a>. Coffee and other agricultural products are among the largest drivers of global <a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2022/06/deforestation-in-coffee-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Assessment followed by commitment</strong></p>



<p>As part of its agreement with Green Century, in 2025, J.M. Smucker will assess the steps necessary to ensure the company uses deforestation-free supplies of coffee, palm, soy and cocoa, as well as wood pulp used in packaging. The company plans to follow the assessment with a transition to deforestation-free supplies in 2026, as commercially feasible. Any policy adopted will include ongoing third-party assurance of forest protection practices as well as a grievance system for reporting violations.</p>



<p><strong>Forest protection is climate protection</strong></p>



<p>Deforestation and destruction of other natural habitats is responsible for <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Forests can also play an important role in removing carbon from the atmosphere, <a href="https://www.woodwellclimate.org/global-forest-carbon-storage-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but only if they are allowed to grow and thrive</a>. The <a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatest driver of deforestation globally is agriculture</a>, making it critical for food companies to commit to deforestation-free ingredients. </p>



<p>&#8220;J.M. Smucker has woken up and smelled the coffee,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;American consumers love their morning joe and they also want to protect the environment. These steps will help J.M. Smucker do both things, and provide sustainable coffee, snacks, and pet products.”</p>

					<h2>Classic Hostess brands agree to use cage-free eggs after Green Century engagement.</h2>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(BOSTON)</strong> J. M. Smucker Co* announced that its Hostess brand, which includes iconic snack products like Twinkies, Snowballs and CupCakes, will be switching completely to direct purchases of cage-free eggs by 2028. J. M. Smucker achieved a 100% cage-free egg supply before acquiring the Hostess brand in 2023. Hostess previously did not use cage-free eggs.</p>
<p>J. M. Smucker Co made the commitment after signing an agreement with Green Century.</p>
<p>“Bringing cage-free eggs to an iconic American brand like Hostess means happier hens and healthier snacks,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We admire Smucker’s commitment, proving that big brands play a key role in building a more ethical food industry.”</p>
<p>Smucker’s provided a glidepath towards reaching its cage-free egg goal and will transparently report on its progress annually in its sustainability report.</p>
<h3>Green Century’s advocacy promotes animal welfare</h3>
<p>Green Century has taken a leading role in promoting animal welfare at major brands advocating for healthy and humane conditions for animals. Carl Icahn nominated Samuelrich in 2022 for the board of McDonald’s after the company backed away from its gestation crate-free pork pledge. Green Century also recently filed a shareholder resolution at Darden, parent company of Olive Garden, asking the company to commit to removing gestation crates from its supply chain.</p>
<p>“Growing visibility into supply chains means that animal welfare can no longer be ‘out of sight, out of mind’,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate</strong>. “Consumers will continue to learn about &#8211; and demand &#8211; better treatment for animals in agriculture.”</p>
<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</strong></p>
