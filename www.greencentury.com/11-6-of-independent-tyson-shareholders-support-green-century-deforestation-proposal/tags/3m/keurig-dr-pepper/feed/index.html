					<h4>Investors concerned over growing evidence of plastic toxicity</h4>
<p>(Boston, MA) Responding to investors’ scrutiny, Keurig Dr Pepper* has expanded its Chemical Management Policy to include forever chemicals PFAS, heavy metals and a family of plastic additives called bisphenols. The move comes after <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/en/2023/05/investors-with-us10-trillion-aum-call-on-corporates-to-drastically-ramp-up-action-on-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">185 investors</a> coordinated by the <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development</a> sent a letter to the company highlighting toxic additives in plastic packaging.</p>
<p>“Plastic packaging can be toxic at every stage of its lifecycle,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate at Green Century° who helped lead the investor engagement. “Thousands of potentially harmful plastic additives have been identified in food packaging. We expect companies to commit to identifying and eliminating the use of hazardous substances and to publicly report on their progress.”</p>
<p>Companies are currently not required to disclose plastic additives to consumers or investors. Of the over <a href="https://ikhapp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SCEPT_Policy_Brief_chemicals_polymers_of_concern_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13,000 chemicals added to plastics</a>, nearly 70% are known to be hazardous or have not been assessed for safety.</p>
<p>A growing body of evidence links plastic and its additives to <a href="https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/files/48995/Pete%20Myers%20testimony.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breast cancer, autism, infertility</a>, and other issues through endocrine disruption, which alter critical hormone functions.</p>
<p>Dr. Pete Myers, of the Environmental Health Sciences, speaking at a recent U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=D8583DB7-BFEE-480C-BBE3-AC1DCE04711B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing</a> emphasized the risks of endocrine disruption from plastic, stating that no plastic has been thoroughly tested using the tools of modern medical science.</p>
<p><strong>Plastic additives impact plastic recyclability, harm ecosystems, and damage human health.</strong></p>
<p>“We appreciate companies expanding chemical management policies, but it is really a bandage on a broken system,” said Guernsey. “What we need is an absolute reduction of single-use plastic, replaced with tested solutions like reusable bottles and plastic-free packaging.”</p>

<p><b>Boston, April 18, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keurig Dr. Pepper*, a leading global beverage company with brands from Snapple to 7Up, will boost efforts to cut single-use plastic by expanding its “reuse and refill” options across the country. In exchange for its heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction in total plastic packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of plastic flowing into our oceans is on pace to </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20plastic%20trash,to%2029%20million%20metric%20tons." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly triple by 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Keurig Dr. Pepper for stepping up its efforts to address the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keurig Dr. Pepper’s planned actions include expanding its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to include more details on refillable and reusable container pilots. Starting in 2023, the company pledged to publish an annual “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its CSR report. By 2024, the company plans to launch new reuse and refill pilots in key U.S. markets where the local infrastructure and culture are conducive to their success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Keurig Dr. Pepper help build a circular economy by providing more reuse options – from soda cups to K-Cup Pods – in communities across the U.S.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Companies such as Keurig Dr. Pepper are beginning to realize that an investment in reusable and refillable containers can mitigate the financial, regulatory, and reputational risks posed by single-use plastics,” added Sanders. “They’re also seeing consumers act, in growing numbers, on the common-sense conviction that nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our planet for hundreds of years.”</span></p>
