<p class="has-text-align-left">Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds°, was named to this year&#8217;s Forbes’ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/50over50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 Over 50 list</a> in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2024/08/01/50-over-50-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investment category</a>, joining the ranks of venture capitalists, wealth managers, philanthropists and others.</p>



<p>The list celebrates women who are pioneers in their fields, leveraging their age and experience as tools for success. The thousands of nominations are narrowed down to 200 finalists in four categories of impact, innovation, investment and lifestyle. This is the fourth year of the annual list and it highlights women who are hitting peaks during life’s second half.</p>



<p>“I am delighted to have been chosen for this recognition and look forward to meeting other prominent changemakers in the fall,” she said. “Green Century applauds the dedication and effort of those involved in this endeavor.”</p>



<p>The list was produced over five months in partnership with Mika Brzezinski and her <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/knowyourvalue?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Pardot&amp;utm_content=EM_1" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.msnbc.com/knowyourvalue?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Pardot&amp;utm_content=EM_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Know Your Value</a> initiative. A team of Forbes reporters, editors, industry experts, alums and others chose the finalists for the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/50over50/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/50over50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 Over 50 list</a>.</p>



<p>An October event in New York City will celebrate the women picked for the list.</p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2024</strong>  – Ford Motor Company shareholders delivered 6.6<strong>%</strong> of votes cast in support of Green Century’s<em>°</em> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465924040871/tm2318496-d4_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolution</a> asking the company to eliminate materials linked to deforestation in its cars and trucks. The proposal also asked Ford to buy more sustainable steel and aluminum, and pushed for the company to purchase steel and aluminum plants that run off of clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Ford family has significant control over Ford business decisions because it owns a special class of stock that ensures it has  <a href="https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/the-ford-family-a-permanent-mark-in-business-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of the voting power</a>. Votes against the Green Century proposal by Ford family members could have negatively impacted the vote result.</p>
<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raising cattle</a>, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting rubber</a>, and <a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/1827220/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining minerals</a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage in vulnerable areas such as Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. Deforestation is now one of the leading drivers of <a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> and <a href="https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/how-does-deforestation-impact-wildlife-and-biodiversity-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biodiversity loss.</a></p>
<p>Heavy emitting industries such as steel and aluminum also contribute to climate change. Currently, not a single ton of sustainable steel and aluminum is manufactured in the United States. Green Century’s proposal asks Ford to join organizations like <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a> and the <a href="https://aluminium-stewardship.org/drive-change/sustainability-priorities/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aluminum Stewardship Initiative</a>, which  develop sustainability certifications for aluminum and steel manufacturers and push them to replace fossil fuels with renewables.</p>
<p>“While we had wished for a higher vote, we’re pleased with the support we received,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Enhancing supply chain sustainably at Ford is a new initiative for us, and we plan to keep pressure on the company to address its material environmental risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Supply Chains Are Key</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, Ford set a target to purchase sustainable steel and aluminum for <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/11/09/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of its total steel and aluminum purchases by 2030</a>. The company also planned to <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/04/ford-updates-timing-for-next-gen-evs--readies-manufacturing-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add EVs to its fleet</a>, which are manufactured with more aluminum than gas-powered cars to offset the extra battery weight. The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative works to ensure that aluminum producers are cutting emissions significantly by 2025. Similarly, ResponsibleSteel has a mission to “&#8230;be a driving force in the socially and environmentally responsible production of net-zero steel, globally.” Ford may benefit by joining both organizations, using its influence as a major consumer of steel and aluminum to press for greener production.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone wants to buy a Ford Explorer or F-150 and learn that the leather, rubber, and minerals in their vehicles contributed to deforestation,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Sustainability needs to be woven into every aspect of Ford’s supply chain, because Green Century believe it’s good for Ford’s investors, customers, and the company itself.”</p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495;</p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p><strong>Boston, March 6, 2024</strong> &#8211; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently finalized its long-awaited <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/33-11275.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate-Related Disclosure rule</a>.</span> Originally proposed two years ago, the rule was crafted in response to investor demand for <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/12/20/why-we-still-need-the-secs-climate-related-disclosures-rule/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20SEC%2C%20the,companies%20in%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent and comprehensive information</a> about climate-related risks and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledgment</a> by federal regulators of such risks to the financial system.</p>
<p>“It’s a step forward, but we feel it&#8217;s too little too late. We wish the SEC had held fast with their proposal to have companies report Scope 3, or indirect, emissions because investors need this data to make informed decisions about how companies are addressing their climate-related risks,” said Green Century Funds° President Leslie Samuelrich. “Companies’ indirect emissions often represent the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%2C%20also%20referred,organizations%20(see%20Figure%201)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority</a> of their total emissions. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/23/sec-expected-to-scale-back-landmark-climate-disclosure-rule-00143046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vigorous opposition</a> by trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation, has restricted investors’ access to vital information.”</p>
<p>The initial draft rule was <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/sec-tees-up-vote-next-week-on-climate-disclosure-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered a victory</a> for investors and <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/news-release-sec-unveils-climate-disclosure-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public interest organizations</a> who were concerned about companies not fully disclosing or downplaying their climate risks. They argued investors could be unknowingly investing billions of dollars in businesses that were not adequately addressing their financial risks.</p>
<p>“Institutional investors have been seeking this information and every day investors would potentially benefit from knowing how the companies in their 401(k), IRAs and other investments are addressing climate risk,” said Samuelrich.</p>
<p>But some business groups opposed the parts of the regulations that require large companies to disclose climate-threatening emissions caused by suppliers and customers and have threatened legal action. However, not including these indirect emissions may result in litigation too. Several nonprofits, including Earthjustice, a leading public interest environmental law nonprofit, indicate they may mount a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-sec-vote-long-awaited-climate-disclosure-rule-notice-says-2024-02-28/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court challenge</a> if major aspects such as indirect carbon emissions, are dropped from the new ruling.</p>
<h3><strong>Regulatory and investor pressure continues  </strong></h3>
<p>Meanwhile, regulatory and investor pressure continues. The new <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Corporate Climate Accountability Act</a> and the European Union’s <a href="https://dart.deloitte.com/USDART/home/publications/deloitte/heads-up/2023/csrd-corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive,</a> will require larger companies to begin reporting their Scope 3 emissions in 2027 and 2025, respectively.</p>
<p>And while mandatory reporting is preferred, many companies already willingly report the greenhouse gas emissions from their operations and supply chains. Green Century recently has worked with several companies, including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-green-century-shareholder-proposal-prompts-costco-commitment-to-set-new-climate-emissions-reduction-targets/">Costco,</a> * <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kroger-to-set-science-based-emissions-reduction-targets-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">Kroger</a>, * and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/corning-sets-ambitious-target-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-embraces-development-of-climate-transition-plan/">Corning</a>* and convinced them to report on their carbon emissions, including Scope 3 emissions.</p>
<p>“Smart companies have recognized climate change as a material risk and already are taking steps to address it. As we say, what gets measured gets managed, and isn’t every investor looking for a well-managed company?” said Samuelrich.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, some important aspects of the rule remain in place.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">The SEC will require companies to explain how severe weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, drought and other natural catastrophes impact their strategies, operations, and financial positions when costs to address such events exceed a certain monetary threshold.</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> The rule will also create a framework to improve the consistency of quantifying Scope 1 and 2 emissions data and will phase in a requirement for third-party verification depending on the size of the company.</span></p>

<p><strong>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> The Walt Disney Company* has agreed to disclose how much plastic it’s using in certain areas of its business and to set an additional plastic reduction goal, thanks to an agreement with Green Century Funds°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund. The Walt Disney Company will release its disclosures in 2025 and will publish the additional plastic reduction goal the following year. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<h4><span data-contrast="auto">The new commitments come as regulatory and economic pressures have pushed companies to disclose and reduce the use of non-essential single-use plastic.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It’s crucial that investors know how a company is addressing its environmental risks and Walt Disney’s commitment will provide important information through its new reporting,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</strong>. “It’s a win for the company since single-use plastic is widely unpopular with consumers who recognize that plastics will pollute our environment for generations to come.”  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Disney had previously taken significant steps towards reducing single-use plastic, including committing to eliminate single-use plastic on cruise ships by 2025, introducing plastic free packaging, and by committing to achieve zero waste to landfill for its wholly owned and operated parks and resorts by 2030.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These new commitments to disclose and to reduce unnecessary plastic will increase transparency and better position the company for a more sustainable future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“The green bottom line is that reducing plastic waste is a win for businesses and for the planet,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “Green Century is excited that the company is committed to these transparency measures that investors will value.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Plastic waste is one of the most durable and growing forms of pollution. It is estimated that every piece of plastic produced in the last 60 years that hasn’t been burned is still in the environment. According to a report from PEW Charitable Trust, if current plastic use trends continue, the amount of plastic leaking into oceans will triple, and the amount of plastic in the oceans will quadruple by 2040. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While many methods will be needed to reduce plastic pollution, recommendations from scientists and experts are for an absolute reduction of single-use plastic. Current recycling methods have resulted in only 9% of plastics being recycled, while most plastics labeled with the chasing arrow label are not actually recyclable. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Alternatives to non-essential single-use plastic already exist,” said Guernsey. “From refillable and reusable containers to recycled paper, corporations have options to reduce risk in this sector. Frankly, much of the single-use plastic we use is like the name states – non-essential.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495; Annie Sanders, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 14, 2024</strong> – A noteworthy 11.6% of independent Tyson Foods* shareholders voted in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal urging the company to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains by 2025. Independent shareholders include all shares that are not held by Tyson Limited Partnership or Tyson’s directors or executive officers.</p>
<p>“Independent shareholders have sent a strong message that Tyson can’t put deforestation on the back burner,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. “Tyson should step up to the plate and make sure its meat doesn’t come with a side of forest destruction.”</p>
<p>The pace of deforestation broke records in 2023 in the Brazilian Cerrado, the world&#8217;s most biologically rich savanna, surging by nearly 45% since 2022. To produce its extensive line of meat products, Tyson Foods buys ingredients from countries around the world, including from high-risk regions such as Brazil where cattle ranching is the largest driver of <a href="https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/brasil/tnc-execs-environmentalframeworkcattle.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Tyson’s Deforestation Goals Fall Short</strong></span></p>
<p>Tyson aims to achieve a deforestation-free beef supply chain by the end of 2028 and to eliminate deforestation in its soy and palm oil supply chains by 2030. These goals fall 3-5 years short of recommendations from standard-setting bodies that have concluded that companies can’t hit their climate targets without eliminating deforestation by <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors/forest-land-and-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025</a>.</p>
<p>Tyson also lags peers including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-hormel-foods-commits-to-no-deforestation-by-2025/">Hormel Foods</a>* and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/processed-food-giant-conagra-to-eliminate-deforestation-from-its-supply-chains/">Conagra</a>*, both of which recently pledged to be deforestation-free by 2025.</p>
<p>“This vote demonstrates a growing understanding among investors that deforestation in Tyson’s supply chain exposes the company to material risks,” said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “We urge the company to take investor concern seriously and accelerate progress toward zero-deforestation.”</p>
<p>The Tyson family’s control of Class B shares means it holds up to 70% of the voting rights at the <a href="https://www.pionline.com/governance/new-york-state-common-challenges-tysons-dual-share-stock-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company</a>. The support from independent shareholders is approximate and was calculated under the assumption that Tyson insiders, Tyson Limited Partnership, Tyson’s directors, and executive officers voted against the proposal.</p>

<p><b>The first week of July, 2023 was the hottest week on record</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Meteorological Organization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (WMO). This is following the hottest June on record. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WMO released a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Monday about monitoring potential new record temperature from massive heat waves across the U.S. and spanning several continents. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b></b></p>
<p><b>“We are in uncharted territory,”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said Christopher Hewitt, director of climate services at the WMO. “We can expect more records to fall … these impacts will extend into 2024. This is worrying news for the planet.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The erratic weather is linked to increasing levels of carbon pollution and climate change. We believe oil and gas companies knew that their products would create these problems but misled their shareholders and the public for years about the climate consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds, said the need to avoid fossil fuel investments is crucial and urged actions to help curb the effects of climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While fossil fuel executives reap the economic benefits of their reckless activities, every day people are left to deal with extreme heat or overflowing rivers due to weather made more extreme and erratic due to climate change,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “Having your investments reflect your values is one way for us to take control and work for solutions.”</span></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 2, 2023</strong> &#8211; Shareholders have weighed in on a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century° and the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asking McDonald’s to establish a more ambitious policy to eliminate use of medically important antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains. McDonald’s published the vote tally on Thursday which showed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390823000059/mcd-20230525.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.6% of votes cast</a> were in favor of the proposal.</p>
<p>In its opposition statement, McDonald’s acknowledges that antimicrobial resistance “is a critical global public health issue that we believe we and our suppliers have a responsibility to help address.” The term antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often used interchangeably with antibiotic resistance, but can also describe non-bacterial resistant diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies antimicrobial resistance as a global public health crisis that threatens to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0712-Antimicrobial-Resistance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse medical progress</a>, and the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies antimicrobial resistance as “one of the top <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 global public health threats</a> facing humanity.”</p>
<p>Although McDonald’s first publicized that it would address antibiotic resistance in its food animal supply chain in 2003, it didn’t set reduction targets until 2017, which were narrowly focused on its chicken supply chain. Further, the targets aimed to eliminate only the antibiotics that are highly critical to medicine, failing to protect a wide range of other important antibiotics that humans use to fight infections.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment/">proposal</a> filed by Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters asked McDonald’s to establish a policy that would not only eliminate routine use of all medically important human antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains, but push the company to establish timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, and guidelines for enforcement should suppliers fail to meet McDonald’s targets.</p>
<p>In December 2022, McDonald’s did <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> reduction, but not elimination, targets that are limited to its beef supply chain in its top 10 markets.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said:</strong></p>
<p>“McDonald’s shareholders have signaled that they want to hold McDonald’s responsible for not living up to its commitments, especially when it comes to animal welfare and protecting human health. We’ll continue to work with the company, but we won’t be satisfied until it takes steps necessary to protect the effectiveness of antibiotics, which are crucial to public health. We’re looking for both action and accountability on its part.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, Green Century Shareholder Advocate, stated:   </strong></p>
<p>“McDonald’s is the largest fast food restaurant in the world. As such, it has the influence to change the way food animals are raised and has the responsibility to protect public health from malicious germs which include dangerous bacteria. When I bite into a Big Mac, I want to know that the beef was sourced responsibly and that it was raised without using antibiotics that I, and society in general, need to stay healthy and whole.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 19, 2023</strong> – – Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc., a food company known for its popular snack brands, such as Chips Ahoy!, Cadbury, Ritz, and Oreo, were reluctant to support a Green Century° <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000130817923000589/lmdlz2023_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a>, as evidenced by the vote tally released on Friday. The proposal, which asks Mondelēz to disclose interim targets for achieving its goal to source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025, captured <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000110398223000025/mdlz-20230517.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.8% of the total vote</a>.</p>
<p>Demand for cage-free eggs, and the supply to match it, has grown dramatically in the U.S. and European Union in recent years –driven by consumer awareness of and desire for humanely-raised animal proteins as well as government pressure on manufacturers to switch to producing cage-free eggs. The term “cage-free” was coined in response to farmers’ use of “battery cages,” where hens are housed in spaces that are smaller than the size of a piece of printer paper.</p>
<p>Mondelēz first announced in 2016 that it would source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025. However, recent company disclosures of current sourcing volumes indicate that it is unlikely to meet its goal, which prompted the Green Century proposal. In recent years, excluding its Russian and Ukrainian egg markets, Mondelēz sourced cage-free eggs at a rate of 27% in 2020, 39% in 2021, and 43% in 2022. Extrapolating from its current progress, Mondelēz would achieve a sourcing rate of only 59% by the end of 2025, far short of its original ambition.</p>
<p>However, Mondelēz peers, General Mills and Conagra, disclose their planned progressions toward their global cage-free egg targets and are further along in achieving their goals than Mondelēz. Further, Target and a wide range of quick service food retailers including Jack in the Box, Denny’s, Bloomin’ Brands (the parent of Olive Garden) have also disclosed similar cage-free egg glide paths to their shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> responded to the vote result by saying: </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>“While we had hoped for greater support for our proposal, this is the first year we’ve brought this issue of cage-free egg goals to Mondelēz shareholders for a vote. Without publishing a clear path for achieving its 2050 cage-free egg sourcing goal, Mondelēz may be inviting unnecessary risk by being seen as not living up to its obligations. This is especially true because we’re talking about a sensitive animal welfare issue that has quite a bit of public support.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Disclosure is central to investor decision making, but Mondelēz has told us that disclosing interim targets for its 100% cage-free egg by 2050 goal would be “burdensome, unnecessary…. and could generate confusion among our stakeholders.” Given that it’s now 2023 and Mondelēz committed to reach its goal in 2025, one has to ask, does it really have a plan? If so, why wouldn’t it share it with investors?  For the sake of its investors, customers, and the health of the animals in its supply chain, I hope it does and it will.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>

<p><b>Boston, April 18, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keurig Dr. Pepper*, a leading global beverage company with brands from Snapple to 7Up, will boost efforts to cut single-use plastic by expanding its “reuse and refill” options across the country. In exchange for its heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction in total plastic packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of plastic flowing into our oceans is on pace to </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20plastic%20trash,to%2029%20million%20metric%20tons." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly triple by 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Keurig Dr. Pepper for stepping up its efforts to address the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keurig Dr. Pepper’s planned actions include expanding its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to include more details on refillable and reusable container pilots. Starting in 2023, the company pledged to publish an annual “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its CSR report. By 2024, the company plans to launch new reuse and refill pilots in key U.S. markets where the local infrastructure and culture are conducive to their success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Keurig Dr. Pepper help build a circular economy by providing more reuse options – from soda cups to K-Cup Pods – in communities across the U.S.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Companies such as Keurig Dr. Pepper are beginning to realize that an investment in reusable and refillable containers can mitigate the financial, regulatory, and reputational risks posed by single-use plastics,” added Sanders. “They’re also seeing consumers act, in growing numbers, on the common-sense conviction that nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our planet for hundreds of years.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Director of Communications, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, April 17, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Colgate-Palmolive*, a leading global consumer products </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3456/colgate-palmolive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will enhance its efforts to reduce plastic packaging and scale up reuse models that cut down on single-use plastic. In exchange for this heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Capital Management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction of total plastic packaging use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/10/breakingtheplasticwave_mainreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 million tons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of plastic waste is released into the ocean annually, </span><a href="https://conserveturtles.org/information-sea-turtles-threats-marine-debris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killing more than 1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marine animals each year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Colgate-Palmolive for stepping up its efforts to tackle the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Colgate-Palmolive to accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colgate-Palmolive’s planned actions include more thorough disclosure in future sustainability reports of </span><a href="https://www.colgatepalmolive.com/en-us/who-we-are/stories/plastic-commitments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reuse pilots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company has launched or planned, such as refillable jars for toothpaste tablets and Palmolive dish gel sold in refillable bottles. The company also will publish a “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its upcoming 2023 sustainability report and accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction that will prioritize packaging redesign and expansion of reuse and refill models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s clear that we can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Colgate-Palmolive significantly reduce its total contribution to plastic waste as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #008000;">States will make producers responsible for the waste they create</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s focus on plastic reduction comes not a moment too soon: a December 2022 survey found that 84% of registered U.S. voters support increasing the use of reusable packaging and foodware, and 80% support requiring companies to reduce their single-use </span><a href="https://usa.oceana.org/press-releases/americans-are-sick-of-single-use-plastic-pollution-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic packaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Governments are also taking note: since 2021, Maine, Oregon, California and Colorado have adopted the nation’s first producer responsibility laws for consumer packaging, which will make producers financially responsible for the packaging waste they create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our environment for centuries,” added Sanders. “Reuse and refill models, which </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rank among the most effective ways to replace single-use plastics, are critical solutions that companies must urgently scale up to meet one of the most profound environmental challenges of our time.” </span></p>
