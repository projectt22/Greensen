<p><strong>Boston, October 21, 2024 – </strong>Lowe’s Home Improvement*, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, announced significant progress toward its goal of reducing the sale of gasoline-powered lawn care equipment at its stores across the United States and Canada. The company’s latest sustainability report disclosed that 60% of the powered lawn care equipment it sold, not including riding lawn mowers, was battery-powered. The information was provided as part of an agreement with Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>



<p>The report highlights the importance of the company ramping up the sale of battery-powered lawn care equipment to meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. The emissions caused by running all 1,745 Lowe’s stores is a tiny fraction of the emissions created by people using the products they purchase at Lowe’s – less than one half of one percent.</p>



<p><br>“We are pleased to see that Lowe’s supports the move away from polluting and noisy gas-powered lawn equipment to cleaner and quieter options,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “Battery-powered lawn equipment is better for investors and the environment, and we encourage Lowe’s’ to build on this momentum.”</p>



<p><strong>A few items can have a large climate impact</strong></p>



<p><br>Gas-powered lawn care equipment emitted more than 30 million tons of carbon dioxide and nearly 19,000 tons of methane <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/resources/lawn-care-goes-electric/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2020</a> in the U.S. Replacing this equipment with electric alternatives would provide an emissions reduction equivalent to taking as many as 6.5 million gasoline-powered cars <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=typical%20passenger%20vehicle%3F-,A%20typical%20passenger%20vehicle%20emits%20about%204.6%20metric%20tons%20of,around%2011%2C500%20miles%20per%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener">off the road</a>.</p>



<p><br>“Lowe’s has made a commitment to cut its greenhouse gas emissions,” said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “This report makes clear that one of the simplest and fastest way for Lowe’s to do that is to replace gasoline-powered lawnmowers and leaf blowers with cleaner, quieter, electric models.”</p>



<p><br><strong>States, retailers and reviewers increasingly favor electric products</strong></p>



<p>States have begun taking action to limit the sale of gas-powered lawn care equipment or encourage the sale of battery alternatives. California banned the sale of most gasoline-powered <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/small-off-road-engines-sore/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawn care equipment</a> on January 1, 2024. Colorado now offers a 30% rebate to consumers purchasing electric <a href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/colorado-boosts-emission-reduction-goals-and-climate-tax-incentives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawn care equipment</a>.</p>



<p><br>Lowe’s competitor Home Depot has said that 85% of its lawn care equipment will be electric by 2028.</p>



<p><br>The New York Times product review site <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wirecutter</a> gives top marks to battery-powered models in its recommendations for lawnmowers, leaf blowers, and string trimmers. Consumer Reports also positively reviews electric models, noting that they are quieter and easier to maintain than their gas-powered counterparts.</p>

<p><strong>Media Contact:</strong> Thomas Peterson, tpeterson@greencentury.com, 781-349-2615; Josh Chetwynd, jchetwynd@greencentury.com, 303-573-5558</p>



<p><strong>Boston, March 25, 2022</strong> – Green Century° has withdrawn a shareholder proposal filed with Lowe’s* after the home improvement retailer agreed to both disclose the impact of its sourcing on primary forests, which are forests that have never been logged and have experienced minimal human disturbance, and develop a strategy to mitigate climate, biodiversity and human rights risks associated with its wood sourcing. The company also pledged to report on how it is operationalizing its <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/our-responsibilities/corporate-responsibility-reports-policies/lowes-wood-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wood Sourcing Policy</a>, which includes pledges to avoid high conservation value forests and wood from the habitat of threatened species. Lowe’s is one of the world&#8217;s largest home improvement retailers and a major purchaser of wood products.</p>



<p>“In evaluating an end to sourcing from primary forests, Lowe’s has taken an important step toward addressing deforestation risk,” said Thomas Peterson, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “If we are to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and mitigate biodiversity collapse, companies that buy and sell wood products must take action to stop sourcing from primary forests, which are among the most carbon-dense and ecologically significant places on Earth.”</p>



<p>As requested in Green Century’s shareholder proposal, Lowe’s has agreed to produce a report to assess how it might eliminate deforestation and primary forest degradation. The company has also committed to exploring a requirement that suppliers obtain Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) from indigenous communities.</p>



<p>In addition, Lowe’s recently announced plans to <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/stories/fresh-thinking/lowes-science-based-net-zero-target-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set science-based net zero emissions targets this year</a>. These targets will cover emissions from Lowe’s supply chain, including forestry-related emissions.</p>



<p>Deforestation and primary forest degradation are responsible for approximately 13% of global greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to biodiversity loss. Roughly 90% of Lowe’s wood comes from North America, including from Canada’s boreal forest. Boreal forests harbor significant biodiversity and are critical carbon storehouses, holding approximately a third of all terrestrial carbon. Canada’s boreal, which constitutes 25% of the world’s remaining intact forest and stores twice as much carbon per hectare as tropical forests, experiences the third-highest rate of intact forest loss globally, releasing tens of millions of metric tons of carbon annually. Demand for wood products is a primary driver of industrial clearcutting in Canada.</p>



<p>Green Century’s engagement with Lowe’s follows our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">landmark shareholder proposal with Procter &amp; Gamble*</a>, which earned a majority shareholder vote in fall 2020 and called on the company to take action on deforestation and forest degradation, with a focus on wood pulp sourcing from Canada’s boreal forest. Since that majority vote, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">Procter &amp; Gamble has improved its deforestation policies, but has stopped short of ending sourcing from primary forests</a>.</p>
