<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="387" height="258" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-24051" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1.jpg 387w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alain_rieder?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alain Rieder</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/black-whale-W3uctt_p_os?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>9. Pressing tech companies to curb emissions.</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>While IBM* has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-31-of-ibm-shareholders-support-green-century-climate-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</a></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>7. Protecting rare natural spaces</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br><span style="font-size: 17.897px;">Chemours*: The Okefenokee is one of the largest freshwater wetlands in the world, a massive carbon sink, and home to over 1,000 species of plants and animals. In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Chemours &#8211; the DuPont chemical company spinoff &#8211; agreed in 2022 to not buy titanium sourced from mines adjacent to the Okefenokee. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/investors-call-on-chemours-to-stay-out-of-the-okefenokee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century continued to press Chemours in 2024 to make that commitment permanent.</a> </span></span></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>6. <span style="font-size: 17.897px;">Unwavering commitment to fossil fuel free funds</span></strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century</a> helped lead the fossil fuel free investing movement so individuals have the opportunity to invest without supporting the industry that has driven climate change.  Other mutual funds in the responsible investing space had followed Green Century’s lead but now are backtracking. You can count on Green Century to remain steadfast in its opposition to coal, oil, gas and other environmentally dangerous industries including nuclear power. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					<p><strong>Boston &#8211; </strong>Mattel, Inc.*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to report on its single-use plastic in packaging to the standardized reporting framework CDP in 2025 after reaching an agreement with <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century</a>°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>Mattel uses plastic packaging for its popular toy brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, and continues to develop ways to improve the sustainability of its packaging.</p>
<p>“We have tremendous respect for the team at Mattel and applaud the company’s commitment to transparency,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Accurate data is critical for decision making, and this new commitment will let investors look ‘into the box’ to view how Mattel is reducing plastic waste.”</p>
<p>Mattel and Green Century had previously reached a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/">deal</a> in which Mattel agreed to set a company-wide plastic reduction goal. Mattel fulfilled that agreement in 2022 by committing to reduce its plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030.</p>
<p>This additional commitment to disclose information on single-use plastic in packaging to CDP will help stakeholders better understand Mattel’s sustainable packaging efforts through a recognized, standardized reporting platform.</p>
<h3><strong>Mattel to join 3,000 global companies reporting to CDP Plastic</strong></h3>
<p>Standardized reporting is an essential first step in reducing plastic pollution.</p>
<p>“Right now, each company discloses plastic information in different ways, making it nearly impossible for governments, recyclers, and investors to really know what plastic is out there,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We really view CDP as the gold standard when it comes to voluntary disclosure.”</p>
<h3><strong>Plastic pollution continues explosive growth</strong></h3>
<p>The current plastic waste system has failed to keep plastic out of the ecosystem. Only <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/campaigns/beyond-plastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastic waste is recycled</a>, while plastic pollution has doubled every six years.</p>
<p>Plastic waste makes its way into waterways, killing marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, as plastic doesn’t break down like other materials, small particles of “<a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/updates/microplastics-in-100-of-the-co-waterways-we-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics</a>” have been found in every environment and even the human bloodstream.</p>
<p>The issue has increasingly alarmed consumers and investors. Over <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of respondents to a recent survey have asked companies to use less single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Companies’ efforts to improve sustainability of their products and packaging are an important aspect of helping to protect the planet for future generations.</p>

<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Hasbro*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to full disclosure of its plastic packaging use in 2024 after reaching an agreement with Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>The toy industry is by far the most plastic intensive consumer goods industry in the world.  Revealing plastic use, or disclosure, is a critical first step in reducing plastic pollution, which has nearly quadrupled in the past 20 years, and reducing material risks.</p>
<p>“With this commitment, Hasbro provides the transparency that investors want and need” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Once Hasbro compiles its data, we encourage the company to use it to make stronger commitments to reduce its non-essential single-use plastic.”</p>
<h4><strong>Transparency is a first step towards sustainability</strong></h4>
<p>Plastic waste has passed the crisis stage. Plastic production has grown explosively in the past 60 years, with estimates predicting we will produce nearly 1480 million tons of plastic by 2050.</p>
<p>Of this, only 9% is likely to be recycled. In fact, plastic is more likely to be burned than recycled, with disastrous consequences for children living near incineration facilities. All other plastic results in waste that doesn’t degrade but breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics which pollute our oceans, soil, atmosphere and even our bloodstream.</p>
<p>Green Century has been engaging companies about their plastic use and waste for three years and has secured more than a dozen agreements with companies including Disney,* Costco,* and Mattel*.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, disclosure is about accountability and empowering consumers, managers and investors to make better decisions,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate</strong> with Green Century. “By improving transparency of its plastic use, Hasbro is positioning itself to be a more sustainable company.”<a href="http://www.greencentury.com"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-17909 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png" alt="" width="300" height="88" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Boston, April 27, 2022 – </strong>Mattel, one of the world’s largest toy companies, announced Wednesday that it plans to reduce the amount of plastic packaging with its products. The company, which makes a wide array of popular toys from Barbie dolls to Hot Wheels cars, <a href="https://corporate.mattel.com/news/mattel-announces-goal-to-reduce-plastic-packaging-by-25-per-product-by-2030-and-publishes-latest-citizenship-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>a new goal to reduce plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030, after reaching an agreement last year with Green Century for the environmentally responsible fund to withdraw a shareholder proposal.</p>



<p>Mattel has already increased its disclosure about packaging materials as part of this agreement, reporting on how much recycled content it uses in its <a href="https://corporate.mattel.com/content/dam/corp-site/pdfs/Mattel-2020-Citizenship-Report-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 </a><a href="https://corporate.mattel.com/content/dam/corp-site/pdfs/Mattel-2020-Citizenship-Report-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizenship </a><a href="https://corporate.mattel.com/content/dam/corp-site/pdfs/Mattel-2020-Citizenship-Report-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Report</a>. With this new goal, Mattel is aligning itself with some of its competitors in the toy industry, such as Hasbro, which has pledged to eliminate plastic in all new product packaging by the end of this year.</p>



<p>Plastic pollution in the ocean is projected to increase significantly in the coming decades, with some estimates predicting a rise to 29 million tons annually by 2040. The UN Environment Programme has classified the toy industry as <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/9238/-Valuing%20plastic%3a%20the%20business%20case%20for%20measuring%2c%20managing%20and%20disclosing%20plastic%20use%20in%20the%20consumer%20goods%20industry-2014Valuing%20plasticsF.pdf?sequence=8&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most plastic-intensive</a> in the world, making it all the more important that toy companies assess their plastic use and related risks.</p>



<p><strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management, released the following statement</strong>:</p>



<p>“You don’t even realize how much plastic comes with a toy until you see the mess left behind at a child’s birthday party or during the holiday season. Kudos to Mattel for addressing its role in the toy industry’s plastic packaging problem. Mattel’s new goal is particularly important because it addresses the company’s total plastic use, not just reducing new plastic in favor of recycled material.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a step forward in having children enjoy their favorite toys without parents dealing with unnecessary plastic packaging. Making outright cuts to plastic use is critical for addressing plastic pollution’s impacts on wildlife and the climate, and we encourage more companies to follow in Mattel’s footsteps.”</p>
