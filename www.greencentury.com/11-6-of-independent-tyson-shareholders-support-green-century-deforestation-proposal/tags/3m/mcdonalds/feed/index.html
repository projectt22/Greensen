<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 10.5% of McDonald’s* shareholders cast their votes in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to assess whether its existing climate policies and plans are sufficient to achieve its emissions reduction targets. The resolution, which went to the ballot Tuesday, requests details on McDonald’s progress toward reaching its net-zero emissions by 2050 goal</p>



<p>“McDonald’s commitment to reducing carbon pollution shows that the company understands the risks that a warming planet poses to its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Now, McDonald’s must assure investors that it will live up to its commitments and take the necessary steps to meaningfully reduce climate-related risks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef has an outsized climate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/food-systems-responsible-for-one-third-of-human-caused-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our food system</a> accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and few meals we eat contribute to those emissions more than a burger. The life cycle of beef from farm to fork<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emits more greenhouse gas emissions</a> per kilogram than any other food, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular fast-food restaurants can play a key role in addressing climate change by buying and selling beef produced with processes that reduce emissions. Chains including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have added alternative-protein patties to their menus. Diversifying protein options to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption of beef is one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical method to cutting climate emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>McDonald’s </strong><strong>is slow </strong><strong>to show progress&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s set short- and long-term targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with what science says is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Because beef makes up about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/the-carbon-footprint-of-mcdonald-s-menu-very-big" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of the company&#8217;s total climate footprint</a>, reducing beef-related emissions is an impactful strategy to achieve its climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the climate risks of increasing emissions, McDonald’s is exposing itself to reputational risk by failing to illustrate it is on track to meet its climate commitments. <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/greenwashing-rising-report-rep-risk-social-washing-sustainability/696289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental groups </a>have suggested companies, <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/mcdonalds-greenwashing-2655223811.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including McDonald’s</a>, may be misleading customers about the extent of their climate action, a phenomenon called “greenwashing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s has several initiatives to decrease the emissions from beef production. These plans aim to<a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce beef more sustainably</a> and<a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve soil’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide</a>. Still, the company <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/the-mcplant-is-out-but-the-mcrib-will-be-back-heres-when/476654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinued its only plant-based burger</a> in the United States, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its largest </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market</a> in terms of system-wide sales, signaling alternative proteins may not be a part of its approach to cutting climate emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“McDonald’s lacks alternative protein options that would help it reduce its beef-related emissions and demonstrate progress toward achieving its goals,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>hareholder </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>dvocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The happiest meal for investors is one that shows the company is reducing emissions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 2, 2023</strong> &#8211; Shareholders have weighed in on a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century° and the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asking McDonald’s to establish a more ambitious policy to eliminate use of medically important antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains. McDonald’s published the vote tally on Thursday which showed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390823000059/mcd-20230525.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.6% of votes cast</a> were in favor of the proposal.</p>
<p>In its opposition statement, McDonald’s acknowledges that antimicrobial resistance “is a critical global public health issue that we believe we and our suppliers have a responsibility to help address.” The term antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often used interchangeably with antibiotic resistance, but can also describe non-bacterial resistant diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies antimicrobial resistance as a global public health crisis that threatens to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0712-Antimicrobial-Resistance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse medical progress</a>, and the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies antimicrobial resistance as “one of the top <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 global public health threats</a> facing humanity.”</p>
<p>Although McDonald’s first publicized that it would address antibiotic resistance in its food animal supply chain in 2003, it didn’t set reduction targets until 2017, which were narrowly focused on its chicken supply chain. Further, the targets aimed to eliminate only the antibiotics that are highly critical to medicine, failing to protect a wide range of other important antibiotics that humans use to fight infections.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment/">proposal</a> filed by Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters asked McDonald’s to establish a policy that would not only eliminate routine use of all medically important human antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains, but push the company to establish timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, and guidelines for enforcement should suppliers fail to meet McDonald’s targets.</p>
<p>In December 2022, McDonald’s did <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> reduction, but not elimination, targets that are limited to its beef supply chain in its top 10 markets.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said:</strong></p>
<p>“McDonald’s shareholders have signaled that they want to hold McDonald’s responsible for not living up to its commitments, especially when it comes to animal welfare and protecting human health. We’ll continue to work with the company, but we won’t be satisfied until it takes steps necessary to protect the effectiveness of antibiotics, which are crucial to public health. We’re looking for both action and accountability on its part.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, Green Century Shareholder Advocate, stated:   </strong></p>
<p>“McDonald’s is the largest fast food restaurant in the world. As such, it has the influence to change the way food animals are raised and has the responsibility to protect public health from malicious germs which include dangerous bacteria. When I bite into a Big Mac, I want to know that the beef was sourced responsibly and that it was raised without using antibiotics that I, and society in general, need to stay healthy and whole.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2023</strong> &#8211; Green Century° and the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, have filed a shareholder proposal with McDonald’s urging it to eliminate routine use of antibiotics that are important to protecting human health on the animals in its supply chains. The proposal goes to a vote on Thursday, May 25.</p>
<p>The Sisters had previously pressed McDonald’s to engage its pork and beef suppliers to phase out use of the types of antibiotics on their animals that people also use. In 2018, the Sisters filed a similar proposal and withdrew it in exchange for McDonald’s promise to announce reduction targets by 2020. McDonald’s failed to meet its promise.</p>
<p>Administering low doses of antibiotics in food and water can spur development of ‘superbugs’ in farm animals and create bacteria so resistant to treatment that even the most potent antibiotics can fail to stop the disease. There are a handful of transmission pathways for antibiotic-resistant bacteria that allow them to jump from farm animals to humans. Infection can happen through handling bacteria-laden meat from the supermarket, drinking water polluted by farm runoff, and direct contact with animals by farm workers and meat processors. In 2021, the United Nations announced that we may soon reach a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1106472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘tipping point’</a> when antimicrobial resistance becomes the leading cause of death – surpassing heart disease.</p>
<p>McDonald’s new <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsible use policy</a> encourages producers and veterinary professionals, among others, to “share responsibility for proactively developing and implementing effective best management strategies to reduce, and where possible eliminate, the need for [medically-important] antibiotic use.”</p>
<p>However, the policy falls short of the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment/">proposal’s request</a>. Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters had asked McDonald’s address use of antibiotics in its pork as well as beef supply chains. Further, the policy does not address the need for elimination targets, timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, or guidelines for enforcement when suppliers fail to meet McDonald’s guidelines.</p>
<p>“The upcoming vote is an opportunity for shareholders to assess the gap between what McDonald’s had stated it would do in the past to its new responsible use policy,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “In 2018, McDonald’s promised the nuns that it would announce targets by the end of 2020. It reneged and provided a responsible use policy that has no teeth. In my opinion, it appears to be more aspirational than actionable.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>
