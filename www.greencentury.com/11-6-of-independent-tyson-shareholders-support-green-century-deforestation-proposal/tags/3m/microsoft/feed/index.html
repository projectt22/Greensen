					<p><strong>(Boston) </strong>Microsoft Corporation* <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be offering extended security updates (ESU) for Microsoft Education customers at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century°</a>, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/microsoft-extends-security-support-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">pushed</a> Microsoft to announce affordable ESU for Windows 10 computers. This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest jump in junked computers ever</a>.</p>
<p>“This allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong>, President of <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century Funds</a>. “It is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.”</p>
<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/10/windows_11_adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">330-400 million devices</a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000 petition signatures</a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.</p>
<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.</p>
<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>
<p>“Getting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate. “We encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.”</p>

					<h3>Green Century Pushed Microsoft to Extend Security Support to Prevent E-Waste</h3>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> &#8211; After engagement with <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century</a>°, Microsoft Corporation* announced it would extend Windows 10 security updates (ESU) for organizations of all sizes, including schools, the public sector, and for the first time, individuals. Microsoft will provide security updates options to devices using Windows 10 past their End of Support (EOS) date of October 14, 2025.</p>
<p>“Your computer shouldn’t become trash just because it can’t get a security update,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “Microsoft’s move may save vital institutions like hospitals and schools billions of dollars and could prevent millions of functioning computers from becoming toxic e-waste.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_18681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18681" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-18681" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Microsfot-300x158.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="158" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18681" class="wp-caption-text">Green Century Pushed Microsoft to Extend Security Support</figcaption></figure>
<p>An estimated 330-400 million devices may not be able to upgrade from Windows 10 because of hardware requirements. Microsoft planned End of Support (EOS) date could lead users to dispose of Windows devices which are not eligible to upgrade because of security concerns.</p>
<p>Reports brought to light and campaigns by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) have suggested that the End of Support for Windows 10 could cause the single biggest jump in junked computers ever.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s new Extended Security Update (ESU) program will cost a fee, the details of which will be released at a later date. The plan for commercial customers such as schools, the public sector, and small and mid-sized businesses will be available for three years. The consumer plan will be available initially for one year.</p>
<h3>Microsoft’s commitment is a good step forward, but the cost of the program could be a barrier to access and remains an issue.</h3>
<p>Critics are concerned that the undisclosed cost of ESUs may limit access to the ESU plan and thus reduce the program’s positive environmental impact. Experts suggest that 33% of computers using Windows 10 will not be able to update to Windows 11 because of hardware requirements. This could lead users to discard their devices prematurely out of concern for performance issues and exposure to security risks, which in turn will cause otherwise working computers to end up in landfills. E-waste is the fastest growing form of waste, yet only a small percentage of it is recycled.</p>
<p>“Microsoft is clearly thinking about its long-term environmental impact by extending critical security updates beyond the End of Support of Windows 10,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Now the company should make these important updates as widely accessible &#8211; and affordable &#8211; as possible.”</p>
<p>The vast majority of the environmental impact of electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry. According to the World Economic Forum, extending the lifespan of phones from three to four years could reduce the number of phones sent to waste by 25%.</p>
