<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2024</strong>  – Ford Motor Company shareholders delivered 6.6<strong>%</strong> of votes cast in support of Green Century’s<em>°</em> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465924040871/tm2318496-d4_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolution</a> asking the company to eliminate materials linked to deforestation in its cars and trucks. The proposal also asked Ford to buy more sustainable steel and aluminum, and pushed for the company to purchase steel and aluminum plants that run off of clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Ford family has significant control over Ford business decisions because it owns a special class of stock that ensures it has  <a href="https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/the-ford-family-a-permanent-mark-in-business-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of the voting power</a>. Votes against the Green Century proposal by Ford family members could have negatively impacted the vote result.</p>
<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raising cattle</a>, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting rubber</a>, and <a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/1827220/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining minerals</a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage in vulnerable areas such as Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. Deforestation is now one of the leading drivers of <a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> and <a href="https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/how-does-deforestation-impact-wildlife-and-biodiversity-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biodiversity loss.</a></p>
<p>Heavy emitting industries such as steel and aluminum also contribute to climate change. Currently, not a single ton of sustainable steel and aluminum is manufactured in the United States. Green Century’s proposal asks Ford to join organizations like <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a> and the <a href="https://aluminium-stewardship.org/drive-change/sustainability-priorities/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aluminum Stewardship Initiative</a>, which  develop sustainability certifications for aluminum and steel manufacturers and push them to replace fossil fuels with renewables.</p>
<p>“While we had wished for a higher vote, we’re pleased with the support we received,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Enhancing supply chain sustainably at Ford is a new initiative for us, and we plan to keep pressure on the company to address its material environmental risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Supply Chains Are Key</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, Ford set a target to purchase sustainable steel and aluminum for <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/11/09/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of its total steel and aluminum purchases by 2030</a>. The company also planned to <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/04/ford-updates-timing-for-next-gen-evs--readies-manufacturing-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add EVs to its fleet</a>, which are manufactured with more aluminum than gas-powered cars to offset the extra battery weight. The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative works to ensure that aluminum producers are cutting emissions significantly by 2025. Similarly, ResponsibleSteel has a mission to “&#8230;be a driving force in the socially and environmentally responsible production of net-zero steel, globally.” Ford may benefit by joining both organizations, using its influence as a major consumer of steel and aluminum to press for greener production.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone wants to buy a Ford Explorer or F-150 and learn that the leather, rubber, and minerals in their vehicles contributed to deforestation,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Sustainability needs to be woven into every aspect of Ford’s supply chain, because Green Century believe it’s good for Ford’s investors, customers, and the company itself.”</p>
