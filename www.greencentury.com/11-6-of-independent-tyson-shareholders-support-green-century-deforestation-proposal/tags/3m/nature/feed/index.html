<p><strong>Boston, May 07, 2025</strong> – Shareholders sent a nature-positive message to PepsiCo* on Wednesday in response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century Capital Management. The proposal asked the company to assess its impact on nature and the systemic risks posed to the company by those impacts on the world around us.</p>



<p>“PepsiCo relies on nature for all the ingredients that go into its products, from corn and spices to fresh water,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company needs to do everything possible to ensure it’s not hurting healthy ecosystems. That will help reduce PepsiCo’s potential nature-related risks.”</p>



<p><strong>The natural world under pressure</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwcboosts-global-nature-and-biodiversity-capabilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half of global GDP </a>is dependent on natural inputs. Yet, the reliability of these inputs is increasingly uncertain. The United States incurred more than <a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-20-billion-question-hanging-over-americas-struggling-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 billion in crop losses last year because of extreme weather</a>. In addition, the global decline in pollinators has destabilized crop yields across two-thirds of the world. The <a href="https://octopart.com/pulse/p/extreme-weather-becomes-new-supply-chain-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disruption of nature </a>also impacts the <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transportation systems </a>that companies such as PepsiCo use to bring products to market. In 2024, wildfires, hurricanes and floods <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/weathers-wrath-supply-chains-reel-from-2024s-extreme-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down transport systems around the globe</a>, causing major disruptions in Canada, Mexico, China and Malaysia, among other places.</p>



<p><strong>Investors want transparency re: Pepsi’s impacts on nature</strong></p>



<p>This is the second year that Green Century has offered PepsiCo’s shareholders a proposal on biodiversity impacts. This year’s proposal was supported by 17.7% of PepsiCo shareholders. This vote will allow the resolution to be submitted again next year if the company does not take action. </p>



<p>“We hope that PepsiCo will hear the message of its shareholders: nature matters,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“Investors shouldn’t have to stay up at night wondering whether our company is putting critical ecosystems at risk to sell Doritos and Mountain Dew.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Green Century° investors help our nonprofit owners and partners conserve wild spaces for many species, ranging from red-tailed hawks soaring above suburban forests to amphibians and other critters accessing wildlife tunnels to survive highway crossings.<br><br>Connecting wildlife to forests, wetlands and other wild places is vital as terrain gets fragmented by development, highways, railroads, fences, dams and other obstacles. Our partners at Environment America Research &amp; Policy Center have explored several projects across the nation to help reconnect nature.<br><br>The <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WEB_AME_Reconnecting-Nature_090121.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reconnecting Nature</a> report details possible solutions and ways to think creatively about conserving and connecting habitats that are increasingly divided by human activity. With boundless tracts vanishing, rewilding and reconnecting nature is vital to healthy ecosystems.<br><br>At stake is the ability for species to follow instinctual migration routes, adapt to climate change, forage for food, water, shelter and mates. The report explores wildlife corridors, including seven projects, and demonstrates how connecting fragmented habitats enables species to recover and thrive. Small-scale projects, networks of conservation easements, land management plans and creation of expansive wildlife refuges help conserve wild spaces so animals can move freely.</p>



<p>As elk, bobcats, bears, birds and other far-ranging creatures&#8217; cross lands, they encounter barriers that make it harder to access resources and other wildlife. Wild spaces carved up by logging, rangelands, fences and other developments isolate and confine large game animals that need wilderness to thrive and survive. <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-your-legislators-invest-in-wildlife-crossings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take action here. <br></a><br>Building on existing wildlife protections at federal, state and local levels, <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/articles/pennsylvania-wildlife-corridors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wildlife corridors can help with survival during highway crossings</a>, adaptation to climate change and animals chasing cooler temperatures, and other diminished habitat. The goals include safe passage, reconnected lands, preserving biodiversity and healthy ecosystems.<br><br>At Green Century, your investments support our nonprofit owners and partners as they help conserve and protect our lands, air, waters and wildlife.</p>

<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 2, 2024</strong> – Green Century Capital Management<em>° </em>presented its <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/docs/default-source/annual-reports/2024-pepsico-proxy-statement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal for biodiversity and nature reporting </a>at PepsiCo’s annual general meeting on May 1.  In response, approximately 18% of company shareholders voted in favor, bucking a strong push by PepsiCo management against the initiative.</p>
<p>“We’re gratified that a significant number of PepsiCo shareholders stood up for nature,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. “PepsiCo relies on nature for all the products it sells. We hope they hear this clear message from shareholders: the company should account for its reliance on nature, it should disclose its impacts, and it should reduce those impacts wherever possible.”</p>
<p><strong>Strong support leading into the meeting</strong></p>
<p>Ahead of the vote, several large investment groups voiced their support for the proposal, including Norges Bank Investment Management, Allianz Global Investors, and Storebrand Asset Management. The proposal reflects an increased understanding by investors that biodiversity and nature must be considered when evaluating company performance.</p>
<p>“We used to take nature for granted, but we don’t have that luxury anymore,” said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Companies have to ensure their operations have a positive impact on nature. Investors need comprehensive biodiversity reporting through accepted frameworks to have confidence in a company’s behavior.”</p>
<p>Yesterday’s vote was the first time a proposal requesting a comprehensive biodiversity report has been voted on by shareholders of a publicly traded company. Shareholder votes are advisory, and a vote at this level will help ensure the issue stays on the company agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, April 30, 2024</strong> – Shareholders will have their say on Green Century’s<em>° </em><a href="https://www.pepsico.com/docs/default-source/annual-reports/2024-pepsico-proxy-statement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shareholder proposal </a>asking PepsiCo* to assess and report its impacts on nature &amp; biodiversity at its May 1 annual general meeting. PepsiCo touts itself as an environmentally responsible company, but it does not publish a comprehensive report on its nature-related dependencies, impacts, opportunities, and risks.</p>
<p>“PepsiCo shouldn’t take nature for granted,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “The company depends on nature for the ingredients that go into its snacks and the water that goes into its sodas. It should report clearly and fully on how its operations and sourcing impact nature, and how it can lessen that impact.”</p>

<p><strong>Investors Increasingly Concerned with Nature &amp; Biodiversity</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.natureaction100.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investor concern over nature </a>and biodiversity loss have been on the rise as the planet has experienced increased wildfires, megadroughts, the loss of pollinators, and widespread plastic pollution. The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) announced in January that <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">320 companies </a>had committed to reporting under its framework.</p>
<p>Green Century’s resolution at PepsiCo is among the first asking a company to report under TNFD.  The vote will give an indication of how the broader investment community views this issue.  Several large investment groups have <a href="https://www.responsible-investor.com/investor-heavyweights-to-support-biodiversity-proposal-at-pepsico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaled their support</a> in advance of the vote, including Allianz Global Investors, Norges Bank Investment Management, the New York City Comptroller, and Storebrand Asset Management.</p>
<p>“Companies in the food and beverage sector are highly reliant on nature and they have a major impact on nature through their sourcing and packaging,” said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “PepsiCo owes investors a full accounting of the risks it faces and the impact it has, and it owes the planet a full assessment of how it can make its supply chain more nature positive.”</p>
<p>PepsiCo’s annual general meeting will be held on May 1<sup>st</sup>.  The result of the vote will be announced in the following days.</p>
