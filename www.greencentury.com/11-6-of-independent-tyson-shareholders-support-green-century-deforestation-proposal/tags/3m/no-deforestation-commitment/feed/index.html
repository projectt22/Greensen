<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocacy, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 20, 2023</strong> – General Motors released the results of the shareholder vote on a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/">Green Century</a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/"><em>°</em></a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/"> proposal</a> asking the company to improve the sustainability of its aluminum, steel, rubber, and leather supply chains. Votes cast in favor reached 14.3% for this first-year proposal, which asked the company to disclose the environmental impacts of these key materials, procure more low-carbon aluminum and steel, and eliminate deforestation associated with producing leather and rubber.</p>
<p>In recent years, General Motors has set several <a href="https://www.gmsustainability.com/_pdf/resources-and-downloads/GM_2022_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggressive targets</a> – one to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 and another to make and sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035. However, the company has not established clear targets for procuring green steel or aluminum, even though both industries can electrify some of their operations and use renewable energy to do so. Further, GM has yet to join industry associations such as <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a><a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>TM</sup></a>, a coalition which created a certification system for green steel and is working to increase customer demand for green steel manufacturing.</p>
<p>Additionally, GM may be sourcing leather and rubber used for car interiors and tires from areas that are associated with deforestation. For example, in Brazil, which is considered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major source of leather</a> for U.S. auto manufacturers, raising cattle is a leading cause of deforestation. The growth and expansion of rubber plantations in Southeast Asia and West Africa – the two primary areas in the world where latex for car tires is harvested – threatens the destruction of biodiverse ecosystems in those regions. Nevertheless, GM currently lacks public targets, milestones and metrics that would indicate progress toward eliminating its exposure to deforestation from rubber plantation expansion or destruction of tropical forests from cattle ranching.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said:</strong></p>
<p>“We believe that even with a full transition to electric cars and trucks by 2035, GM has exposure to significant environmental risks. Ultimately, we don’t think GM wants to be associated with deforestation. If the company wants to clean up its steel and aluminum supply chains, it should invest now in the transition to low-carbon steel and aluminum. Waiting only postpones much needed emissions cuts across the globe.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, Green Century shareholder advocate, added:   </strong></p>
<p>“As one of the largest auto companies in the world, GM has a leadership role to play in addressing climate and deforestation risk. Many European auto companies, such as BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Volvo, are making commitments to source low-carbon metals. GM has an opportunity to catch up and lead the way for American manufacturers. Moreover, few manufacturers are addressing deforestation risk within their supply chains. GM could set an industry-wide standard by adopting near-term targets for zero deforestation.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Director of Communications, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, March 23, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated* will announce new standards to combat deforestation in response to a Green Century Funds° shareholder proposal, co-filed with As You Sow, asking the company to address deforestation in its supply chains. In exchange, Green Century withdrew its proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To achieve a climate-neutral world by mid-century, companies must drastically curtail activities that</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">contribute to deforestation, which accounts for 12% of global climate </span><a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Green Century Funds President</span> <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We commend The Cheesecake Factory for taking steps to protect tropical forests, biodiversity and our climate.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>New guidance requires companies to eliminate deforestation by 2025</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its upcoming Corporate Social Responsibility report due out in May, The Cheesecake Factory plans to announce </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adherence to the new </span><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sectors/forest-land-and-agriculture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which requires companies to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eliminate deforestation in their supply chains by 2025. The company will also expand reporting on its deforestation-related activities and reductions, including for land-based proteins such as beef, in future CSR reports. </span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Agriculture is the world’s largest contributor to deforestation</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agriculture industry is the world’s largest contributor to deforestation, causing 75 percent of the world’s tropical deforestation, and the beef industry alone is responsible for </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some studies show it will be nearly impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees without ending deforestation in </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/climate-math-what-a-1-point-5-degree-pathway-would-take#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beef, soy, palm oil and wood products drive the majority </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of global deforestation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all of which are important for The Cheesecake Factory’s meals, desserts and packaging,” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Funds’ director of shareholder advocacy. “We look forward to seeing the company work toward eliminating deforestation from its supply chains and supporting the resilience of ecosystems on which its business depends.”</span></p>

<p><b>Boston, March 7, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Morgan Stanley, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks_in_the_United_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the largest banks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the United States, has committed to strengthening its deforestation policies for clients around the world. In response, Green Century Funds° withdrew its related shareholder proposal for Morgan Stanley’s 2023 annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot achieve global climate goals without ending deforestation</span><a href="https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/why-net-zero-needs-deforestation-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in this decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To do that, banks must help mitigate the dangers to forests and biodiversity,” said Green Century Funds President</span><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We are encouraged by Morgan Stanley’s steps to address these risks.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Morgan Stanley will enhance standards for soy, beef, palm oil, and wood products</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In exchange for the withdrawal of Green Century Funds’ shareholder proposal, Morgan Stanley agreed to enhance its existing written standards for palm oil and forestry clients to reflect best practices, as well as create new written policy standards for soy and beef clients operating in regions with high deforestation risk. Beef, soy, palm oil and wood products are responsible for the majority </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of global deforestation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To achieve their climate reduction goals, banks will need to focus on companies that drive deforestation,” said</span><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Funds’ director of shareholder advocacy. “With these new commitments, Morgan Stanley is taking important steps toward meeting its net-zero ambitions.”</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #008000;">New commitment builds on agreements with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This commitment from Morgan Stanley builds on a landmark agreement that Green Century secured</span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/" data-wplink-edit="true"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with JPMorgan Chase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">* in 2021, when JPMorgan became the first U.S.-based bank to require palm oil clients to adopt “No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation” (NDPE) policies, as well as an agreement last year</span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/citigroup-expands-deforestation-policies-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with Citigroup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">* to strengthen its deforestation policies. Morgan Stanley will align with leading NDPE policies while also surpassing JPMorgan with improved timber sector standards. Notably, Morgan Stanley will require best-practice Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification or a time-bound plan to achieve it for clients in high conservation value forests, as well as an enhanced review of beef clients’ no-deforestation policies and practices in high-risk regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agriculture, forestry and other land use change is responsible for</span><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2019/08/4.-SPM_Approved_Microsite_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">23 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, nearly half of which is attributable to deforestation.</span></p>
