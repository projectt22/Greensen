<p><strong>Boston, June 26, 2025</strong> – Conagra Brands*, the parent company of Orville Redenbacher’s, Duncan Hines, Slim Jim and other well-known food brands will assess whether it should replicate the nature and biodiversity protections it employs in forests in non-forest ecosystems such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco in Bolivia, Paraguay and northern Argentina. The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.</p>



<p>“Food companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It’s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.”</p>



<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat</strong></p>



<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina. The Cerrado alone, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5% of all species</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on Earth, has lost </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million acres of natural savanna</a><a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-cerrado-production-and-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in recent decades</a>. This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.</p>



<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection</strong></p>



<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company’s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;It’s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.”</p>

<p>Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, <a href="mailto:asanders@greencentury.com">asanders@greencentury.com</a>, 773-272-6691</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 5, 2024</strong> – The Home Depot*, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, issued a new <a href="https://ir.homedepot.com/~/media/Files/H/HomeDepot-IR/2024/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable forestry report</a> nearly two years after a related shareholder proposal from Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund based in Boston. The <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-majority-of-home-depot-shareholders-support-deforestation-shareholder-proposal-filed-by-green-century/">proposal</a>, which received <a href="https://www.governance-intelligence.com/shareholders-activism/home-depot-shareholders-back-deforestation-and-racial-equity-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64% of the shareholder vote</a> in May 2022, asked the company to assess how it could increase the scale, pace and rigor of its efforts to eliminate deforestation and forest degradation from its supply chains.</p>
<p>The report covers an in-depth assessment of the company’s wood sourcing policies and announces a set of strengthened standards that will protect high-risk regions such as the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cerrado</a> in Brazil, the world&#8217;s most biodiverse savanna and home to 5% of the planet&#8217;s animals and plants. The report also asserts that the wood Home Depot sources from Canada is sustainable, sidestepping concerns that the company’s sourcing policies from the region contribute to degradation of the Canadian boreal forest.</p>
<p>“We applaud Home Depot’s new commitments that will protect more tropical ecosystems and the rich biodiversity our planet needs to thrive,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “However, we believe the company’s Canadian sourcing policies fall short of the standards needed to protect the boreal forest, home to critical wildlife habitat for species such as grizzly bears and caribou.”</p>
<p>In the report, Home Depot announced an expansion of its approach to sustainable sourcing such that by the end of fiscal year 2026, wood products sourced to the U.S. and Canada from an additional set of high-risk regions will be required to bear third-party certification or be plantation-grown. The new policy covers a majority of Home Depot’s overall wood sourcing and includes regions such as the Cerrado, Gran Chaco, and Atlantic Forest biomes in South America.</p>
<p>“Home Depot’s new sustainable wood sourcing policies are a welcome step in the right direction,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annie Sanders</a>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “We congratulate the company for establishing new protections in tropical ecosystems and urge additional steps to more fully protect primary forests in the Canadian boreal.”</p>
<p>The North American boreal forest is the largest intact ecosystem left on the planet. Disturbances from logging in the boreal forest have endangered <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/science/article-across-canada-caribou-are-on-the-edge-of-extinction-a-prominent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half</a> of the iconic woodland caribou herds. Unfortunately, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study</a> shows that logging in Canada’s boreal forest is causing severe damage, harming wildlife and compromising the forest’s ability to absorb and store carbon, which is critical for fighting climate change.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Boston, June 28, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kraft Heinz,* one of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> food and beverage companies in the world, announced a first-ever <a href="http://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/esg/pdf/GlobalDeforestationandConversionFreePolicy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Deforestation- and Conversion-Free Policy</a> in response to a Green Century Funds° shareholder proposal asking the company to eliminate deforestation across its supply chains by 2025. In exchange, Green Century withdrew its proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To achieve a climate-neutral world by mid-century, companies must drastically cut their contribution to deforestation, which accounts for 12% of global climate </span><a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We commend Kraft Heinz for acting to protect tropical forests, biodiversity and our climate.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Kraft Heinz’s new no-deforestation policy helps protect tropical forests</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraft Heinz’s new stance on deforestation is an expansion of its 2018 </span><a href="https://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/pdf/Kraft_Heinz_Sustainable_Palm_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Palm Oil policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that established a commitment to sustainable palm oil. Notably, the new policy sets a 2025 deadline for eliminating deforestation from key commodities in Kraft Heinz’s global supply chains, aligning with recent </span><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientific consensus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The policy covers commodities including beef and soy that are linked to deforestation in tropical regions such as the Brazilian Amazon, which is </span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-animals-live-in-the-amazon-and-8-other-amazon-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home to ten percent of all known species</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and among the last refuges for endangered species from jaguars and pink river dolphins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agriculture industry is the world’s largest contributor to deforestation, causing 75 percent of the world’s tropical deforestation, and the beef industry alone is responsible for </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some studies show it will be nearly impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees without ending deforestation in </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/climate-math-what-a-1-point-5-degree-pathway-would-take#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beef, soy, palm oil and wood products drive the majority </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of global deforestation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many of which are key ingredients in the Kraft Heinz products’ we know and love – from Oscar Meyer meats to Kraft Mac n’ Cheese,” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century&#8217;s Director of Shareholder Advocacy. “We applaud the company’s commitment to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains, thereby helping to protect forests and biodiversity around the world.”</span></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocacy, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 20, 2023</strong> – General Motors released the results of the shareholder vote on a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/">Green Century</a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/"><em>°</em></a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/"> proposal</a> asking the company to improve the sustainability of its aluminum, steel, rubber, and leather supply chains. Votes cast in favor reached 14.3% for this first-year proposal, which asked the company to disclose the environmental impacts of these key materials, procure more low-carbon aluminum and steel, and eliminate deforestation associated with producing leather and rubber.</p>
<p>In recent years, General Motors has set several <a href="https://www.gmsustainability.com/_pdf/resources-and-downloads/GM_2022_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggressive targets</a> – one to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 and another to make and sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035. However, the company has not established clear targets for procuring green steel or aluminum, even though both industries can electrify some of their operations and use renewable energy to do so. Further, GM has yet to join industry associations such as <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a><a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>TM</sup></a>, a coalition which created a certification system for green steel and is working to increase customer demand for green steel manufacturing.</p>
<p>Additionally, GM may be sourcing leather and rubber used for car interiors and tires from areas that are associated with deforestation. For example, in Brazil, which is considered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major source of leather</a> for U.S. auto manufacturers, raising cattle is a leading cause of deforestation. The growth and expansion of rubber plantations in Southeast Asia and West Africa – the two primary areas in the world where latex for car tires is harvested – threatens the destruction of biodiverse ecosystems in those regions. Nevertheless, GM currently lacks public targets, milestones and metrics that would indicate progress toward eliminating its exposure to deforestation from rubber plantation expansion or destruction of tropical forests from cattle ranching.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said:</strong></p>
<p>“We believe that even with a full transition to electric cars and trucks by 2035, GM has exposure to significant environmental risks. Ultimately, we don’t think GM wants to be associated with deforestation. If the company wants to clean up its steel and aluminum supply chains, it should invest now in the transition to low-carbon steel and aluminum. Waiting only postpones much needed emissions cuts across the globe.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, Green Century shareholder advocate, added:   </strong></p>
<p>“As one of the largest auto companies in the world, GM has a leadership role to play in addressing climate and deforestation risk. Many European auto companies, such as BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Volvo, are making commitments to source low-carbon metals. GM has an opportunity to catch up and lead the way for American manufacturers. Moreover, few manufacturers are addressing deforestation risk within their supply chains. GM could set an industry-wide standard by adopting near-term targets for zero deforestation.”</p>

<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-482-0800</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 16, 2023</strong> –  <a href="https://www.bldr.com/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Builders FirstSource</a>, the country’s largest building product supplier to the professional market, released the vote result from its annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday. Green Century° received a notable 21% of the vote in favor of its shareholder proposal, which asks the company to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. The proposal additionally asks the company to set goals for sourcing more renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency in its operations, and procuring zero-emission vehicles.</p>
<p>To implement science-based targets, the company would have to reduce its direct, operational emissions and its indirect emissions including from timber harvested for the lumber it sells. Over <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5000 companies</a>, including competitors <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/stories/fresh-thinking/lowes-science-based-net-zero-target-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/sustainability/home-depot-reduced-carbon-emissions-more-127000-metric-tons-2020-commits-100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, have committed to working with the Science Based Targets initiative, and nearly <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fortune-500-companies-are-acting-on-the-climate-crisis-but-is-it-enough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of all Fortune 500 companies have set some kind of climate change reduction target.</p>
<p>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a> said:</p>
<p>“Last year, we filed a nearly identical proposal at Builders asking for reduction targets which received a resounding ‘yes&#8217; vote from investors &#8211; but Builders took almost no action. The company <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001316835/579d09c7-0f03-4884-baa0-f9a54cd7af4e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relies heavily on timber</a>, which comes from forests that are significantly threatened by climate change. We believe management needs to start taking this risk seriously by measuring, disclosing, and setting reduction targets for its Scope 3 supply chain emissions.”</p>
<h4>Green Century Engaged with Builders FirstSource to Set First Emissions Reduction Targets</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century added:</p>
<p>“At the 11th hour, Builders disclosed its <a href="https://s202.q4cdn.com/867695273/files/doc_downloads/esg/Builders-FirstSource_2023-CSR-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scope 1 and 2 emissions</a>, which cover the direct emissions from its operations, and stated it will set emissions reduction targets for both these categories in 2025. While we appreciate that Builders is now taking action on a part of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-at-builders-firstsource-annual-meeting-green-century-wins-majority-vote-on-climate-change-proposal/">Green Century’s 2022 proposal</a>, the company has not yet measured, disclosed, or set targets for its Scope 3, or supply chain emissions, leaving investors in the dark for what comprises, on average, 75% of companies’ climate <a href="https://www.wri.org/update/trends-show-companies-are-ready-scope-3-reporting-us-climate-disclosure-rule#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%20account%20for%2075%25%20of%20companies,greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20on%20average" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions</a>.”</p>

<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong> Thomas Peterson, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:tpeterson@greencentury.com">tpeterson@greencentury.com</a>,781-349-2615; Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, <a href="mailto:markm@greencentury.com">markm@greencentury.com</a>, 678-427-1671</p>



<p><strong>Boston, May 18, 2022 – </strong>At The Home Depot’s annual meeting on Thursday, shareholders will vote on a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000877232/000121465922005158/o412223px14a6g.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a> from Green Century° calling on the world’s largest home improvement retailer to increase “its efforts to eliminate deforestation and the degradation of primary forests in its supply chains.”</p>



<p>“The Home Depot is lagging behind its peers in ensuring that it is not purchasing wood associated with deforestation or harvested from the world’s last remaining unlogged forests, also known as primary forests,” said Green Century president Leslie Samuelrich. “The Home Depot’s customers deserve assurance that the plywood they are buying isn’t coming at the expense of old growth trees and habitat for endangered species.”</p>



<p>As anyone who’s visited the Home Depot has seen, the company is a major buyer of wood. Recently, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jennifer-skene/home-depot-sourcing-wood-products-its-1999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)</a> criticized the retailer for the inadequacy of its wood sourcing policies. Nevertheless, The Home Depot’s board of directors has recommended that shareholders vote against Green Century’s proposal.</p>



<p>Green Century recently <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/lowes-commits-to-comprehensive-reporting-of-its-forest-footprint-will-also-explore-elimination-of-sourcing-from-primary-forests/">withdrew a similar shareholder proposal filed with Lowe’s*</a> after The Home Depot’s largest competitor agreed to comply with the proposal’s request by disclosing the impact of its sourcing on primary forests and developing a strategy to mitigate potential negative outcomes associated with its wood sourcing for the climate, biodiversity and human rights.</p>



<p>“This proposal gives The Home Depot’s shareholders an opportunity to urge the company to use its buying power to encourage truly sustainable forestry practices,” said Green Century shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson. “To mitigate global warming and limit biodiversity collapse, we must end deforestation as soon as possible and preserve the world’s remaining primary forests. The company’s opposition to this proposal and its limited forest risk disclosures leave investors concerned that management is not taking the material financial risks associated with deforestation seriously.”</p>



<p>While global deforestation <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2022/04/2021-tropical-forest-loss-figures-put-zero-deforestation-goal-by-2030-out-of-reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues at an alarming pace</a>, investor support for deforestation-related shareholder proposals has increased dramatically in recent years. Green Century proposals on deforestation earned record-breaking majority votes at <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">Procter &amp; Gamble’s</a>* annual meeting in 2020 and at major agribusiness <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">Bunge’s</a>* annual meeting in 2021.</p>
