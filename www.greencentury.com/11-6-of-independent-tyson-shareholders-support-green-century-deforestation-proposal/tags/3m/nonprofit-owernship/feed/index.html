<p class="has-text-align-left">Giovanna Eichner found the prospect of effecting change at companies as a worthy and compelling endeavor, so she jumped at a chance to join Green Century° in August as a shareholder advocate.<br><br>Green Century’s award-winning shareholder advocacy team of four people uses the Green Century’s stake as a shareholder to convince companies to change practices for the health of our planet. The team has won victories in a broad swath of issues and industries, including commitments to cut plastics use, protect forests, and reduce carbon footprints.<br><br>The David vs. Goliath dynamic reminded Giovanna of her environmental advocacy efforts at Boston College, where her student government helped convince the college to improve its environmental practices. Their efforts ranged from increasing funding for composting to cutting food waste.<br>“At Green Century, I saw a similar dynamic at play with advocacy and bigger institutions. I was really excited about pursuing climate policies in a way that was advantageous to both,” she said. “I think shareholder advocacy combines both of those elements and really values it.”<br><br><img decoding="async" width="301" height="226" class="wp-image-23532" style="width: 301px;" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg 2420w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1536x1153.jpeg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-2048x1537.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><br><br>Giovanna said she works on climate issues across a dozen industries, ranging from footwear and apparel to insurance and fast-food restaurants. The companies she negotiates with are mostly big-name brands and are in industries that are high carbon emitters. She said Green Century’s strategy also resonated with her.<br><br>“Green Century’s approach is one where you’re looking to make the case to a big institution in a way that benefits them. You must understand and empathize with the other side and convince them that our values are aligned. That is how you get them to buy in!”<br><br>A Somerville resident, Giovanna looks forward to a chance to connect with people who work at Green Century’s nonprofit owners and partners that own the mutual fund firm on campaigns that overlap, and that helps amplify the impact of Funds investors.<br><br>“The nonprofit ownership really stood out to me,” she said. “It shows how Green Century aligns investments with its values by taking all its net profits back to ownership. I also see how collaboration extends beyond financing – there is potential for teamwork on <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">Right to Repair</a>, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">plastics</a> and other issues. We can really support each other. I like how Green Century not only has the values, but also exhibits this with action.&#8221;<br><br>Giovanna grew up in Rockville, Md., and double majored in German and history at Boston College. She taught English in Hamburg on a Fulbright grant for two years, working on community efforts to protect parklands and the diverse bird, plant and other ecological treasures.<br>Giovanna will help press companies for climate policies and practices that help the environment.
