<p><strong>Green Century supports renewable energy sources, despite nuclear power’s resurgence.</strong></p>



<p>As data centers, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and other energy-guzzlers increase demand for power, nuclear energy is being pitched as a solution.<br><br>Data centers already make up roughly 2.5 percent of total U.S. electricity use today, according to <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/articles/a-surge-in-energy-intensive-computing-threatens-americas-renewable-energy-transition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis from Boston Consulting Group</a> — but exploding demand for artificial intelligence could drive that to 7.5 percent by 2030.<br><br>Green Century° remains unabashedly opposed to nuclear power and is unconvinced by arguments that today’s new small modular reactors are safe for people or the environment. Our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/">three mutual funds purposefully exclude fossil fuels</a> because of the associated health and ecological impacts.</p>

<p>Nuclear energy is not clean or safe. Many of us remember the immediate environmental and public health fallouts from the Chernobyl, Fukushima and Three Mile Island disasters. At Chernobyl, a<a href="https://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/resources/health/health-effects-chernobyl-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bout 600 workers at the power plant during the emergency received very high doses of radiation</a> and suffered from <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/radiation-sickness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiation sickness</a>. Those who were exposed to the higher amounts of radiation became sick right away and subsequently died.<br><br>The hundreds of thousands of people who worked as part of the cleanup crews in the years after the accident faced increased risk of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/leukemia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leukemia</a>. Of the approximately 5 million residents of the contaminated areas surrounding, children and adolescents exposed from the Chernobyl accident showed an increased risk of developing <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/thyroid-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thyroid cancer</a>. These “new” small modular reactors. <a href="https://blog.ucs.org/edwin-lyman/five-things-the-nuclear-bros-dont-want-you-to-know-about-small-modular-reactors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, still have potential for failures and are susceptible to the more frequent and intense storms caused by climate change.</p>

<p>Today’s consumers already have safe, clean reliable sources of renewable energy. We don’t need to resort to nuclear power. It’s dangerous and costs more than wind and solar. That’s why Green Century is steadfast in its commitment to avoid investing in nuclear power plants. We believe that any firm representing itself as sustainable or responsible should do the same.<br><br>To learn more about avoiding dirty fossil fuels and dangerous nuclear power plants, get our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Climate-Impact-Report-Indesign.pdf">Clean Energy Issue Impact report</a> and our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide-sign-up/">fossil fuel free guide.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p aria-level="4">Even though I knew for months that an ESG firm was thinking about removing its exclusion on nuclear power producers, I was taken aback when I read their press release. Why would they revert their position and turn to nuclear when investing in renewable energy has grown so dramatically?</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In reading their statement, I didn’t find any satisfactory explanations. Yet this sentence struck me: </span><span data-contrast="auto">“</span><span data-contrast="auto">We believe nuclear energy offers a critical source of fuel, with benefits that include … safety.”  Safety. Let’s start with that. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19354 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/frederic-paulussen-LWnD8U2OReU-unsplash-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></span></b></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Safety. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">The designs for nuclear plants are varied, and there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built, and operated correctly or that a natural disaster, such as the earthquake and tsunami with 30-foot waves that hit the </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/fukushima-nuclear-accident-and-its-implications-nuclear-power-us-and-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> won’t affect it given the increased frequency and intensity of storms  due to climate change. In contrast, wind turbines pose none of these dangers but may pose other potential drawbacks. There also are costs associated with meltdown, mining lung cancer, and waste. Clean, renewables can help reduce such risks. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Cost</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. Nuclear power is among the costliest approaches to solving America’s energy problems. New nuclear power costs about five times more than onshore </span><a href="https://www.oneearth.org/category/wind-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="auto">wind power</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> per kilowatt hour. Per dollar of investment, clean energy solutions – such as energy efficiency and renewable resources – deliver far more energy than nuclear power.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Timing. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">Nuclear takes 5-to-17 years longer between planning and operation than renewable energy does.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Emissions</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. Supporters claim these plants can deliver energy with no carbon emissions but there is no such thing as a zero-emission nuclear power plant. </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">Emissions from nuclear plants are on average 23 times the emissions per unit of electricity generated.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Even existing plants emit due to the continuous mining and refining of uranium needed for the plant. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Waste. </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">The radioactive waste from nuclear power plants stays radioactive for decades and is typically stored in temporary facilities. But even those storage spaces are running out and the industry is turning to more costly options. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p aria-level="4"><b><span data-contrast="auto">Reducing emissions is critical and that’s why I believe sustainable investors should keep nuclear out of responsible and green investing, and instead support the clean renewable energy sector</span></b><b><span data-contrast="auto">.</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Globally, renewables account for about one third of electricity generation—and </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">renewable capacity will meet 35% of global power generation by 2025, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) .</span></b> <span data-contrast="none">The global energy crisis has triggered unprecedented momentum behind renewables, with the world set to add as much renewable power in the next 5 years as it did in the past 20.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We believe the considerable human and environmental safety issues involved with building and running nuclear plants, as well as the lessons from Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima must not be forgotten.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:300,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:348}"> </span></p>
