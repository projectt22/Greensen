<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Boston, February 14, 2024 –</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> Green Century° filed a shareholder proposal with </span><a href="https://www.nxp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">NXP Semiconductors</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> in December, asking the company to develop and publish a climate roadmap or </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/climate-transition-plans-help-companies-cut-carbon-footprint/"><span data-contrast="none">climate transition plan</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. After close collaboration with Green Century, NXP pledged to develop a plan detailing its approach to achieving its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets, allowing Green Century to withdraw its proposal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">NXP is a Dutch company based in Eindhoven, Netherlands and has significant operations in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, and the broader Asia-Pacific region, including China. It both designs and manufactures analog and digital microchips and co-invented technology with Sony that allows consumers to use their <a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/blog/from-bricks-to-brains-mobile-phones-and-the-evolution-of-nfc:BL-MOBILE-PHONES-EVOLUTION-OF-NFC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile phones as electronic wallets</a>. NXP’s chips also allow commuters to use their phones or smart cards to purchase trips on major public transit systems, and  can be found in <a href="https://www.nxp.com/applications/smart-city/identification/electronic-passportepp:ELECTRONIC-PASSPORT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronic passports</a> where they protect sensitive personal information.</span></p>

These plans describe how companies will evolve their business strategies, invest capital, measure progress, and assess anticipated obstacles in order to achieve their GHG emissions reduction targets. They can provide investors assurance that companies’ goals are not just aspirational but actually intended to be fulfilled.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">NXP has already established ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint. For example, it aims to reduce the emissions from its operations by 35% by 2027; in that same year, NXP plans to source 50% renewable energy to power its business. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Asset managers need transparency to adequately assess risks and create value for their investors.   NXP’s climate transition plan is a roadmap that will show how the company will navigate its way to shrinking its carbon footprint.  It will help provide insights into its climate risks, which is a factor that any investors should measure and manage,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a founding member of the </span><a href="https://www.semi.org/en/industry-groups/semiconductor-climate-consortium#:~:text=The%20Semiconductor%20Climate%20Consortium%20is,sectors%20of%20our%20value%20chain." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">Semiconductor Climate Consortium</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, NXP demonstrates its commitment to lessening its impact on the climate. The Consortium urges its members to reduce their GHG emissions to help limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. NXP has taken an important first step toward that goal by committing to set aggressive GHG emissions reduction targets with the Science Based Targets initiative, a globally recognized climate non-profit.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

Green Century would like all our portfolio companies to do the same, which is why our recent engagements have focused on ensuring corporate climate goals are backed up by strategy and action. Climate transition plans are an important way to do this – almost the equivalent of saying ‘show us your homework.’”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
