<p><em>Parnassus drops its exclusionary screens while Green Century reaffirms its commitment to them.</em><br><br>Parnassus Investments recently announced that they were dropping the exclusionary screens it used to restrict the types of companies it invested in. This change opens the floodgates for Parnassus to now invest in every industry, including the ones that they had previously eschewed including:<br><br>• Coal<br>• Oil<br>• Fracking<br>• Tobacco<br>• Guns<br>• Military Weapons<br>• Nuclear Energy<br><br>Why did this change happen? From our point of view, it can’t be because the companies in these industries have changed their core businesses. Tobacco companies produce products that are harmful and potentially fatal to people who smoke and nonsmokers alike.<br><br>Oil companies are still damaging ecosystems in pursuit of a product that scientists link to erratic weather and nuclear energy still produces radioactive waste.<br><br>We believe this rollback will have consequences for Parnassus investors and the financial advisors who have used their funds. The impact is that everyday investors, financial advisors who work with them, and institutional investors may no longer count on Parnassus to keep their clients out of these industries. After seeing Parnassus alter its alignment on previous commitments, advisors may become wary of using Parnassus funds for their clients. As one advisor told us, “We’re not happy with this move. Green Century is one of the few firms I feel like I can trust now.”<br><br>Green Century has worked hard to build that trust for 34 years. I can reiterate our commitment to our investors. We were founded as a firm for people who wanted to align their environmental values with their investments as they saved for the future. In 2014, we became one of the first fossil fuel-free, environmentally responsible fund families. Not every company we invest in is perfect. Still, when we see room for improvement in those companies, we lead a rigorous shareholder advocacy program to negotiate better environmental policies, such as sourcing more clean energy and reducing the use of plastics.</p>



<p>We won’t stray from our mission because our values are baked into our DNA. We are owned by environmental and public health non-profit organizations that speak out for the public and stand up to special interests about problems that affect the public’s health, safety and well-being. That’s who we have been for more than three decades and that’s who will continue to be. You can count on us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many investors – and especially Green Century Funds° investors – can imagine a safer, healthier fossil fuel-free future. That’s why Green Century’s advocates work to convince companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect forests, source renewable energy and more. But as wildfires, floods and extreme temperatures have become more common and climate risk has grown for businesses, we’ve focused on another key driver of the climate crisis: the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Oil and gas corporations need insurance to move forward with fossil fuel exploration and extraction. By refusing to cover these environmentally harmful projects, insurance companies could play a positive role in addressing climate change and avoid significant climate risk: global insured losses from natural disasters last year were estimated at $132 billion, making 2022 the fifth costliest year for insurers on record.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_17513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17513" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17513" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230524_121438-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-17513" class="wp-caption-text">Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger poses outside Travelers’ annual meeting before presenting Green Century Funds’ proposal to phase out coverage of new fossil fuel projects.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>While some European companies have stated they will no longer insure certain types of new oil and gas projects, the U.S. insurance industry has made no such moves. In fact, as U.S. insurers continue to cover major drivers of the climate crisis, they’re sticking customers with the costly consequences: State Farm,* the largest homeowner insurance company in California, announced last month that it would stop selling coverage to homeowners – not just in wildfire zones, but everywhere in the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To convince U.S. insurers to keep up with evolving global standards and avoid future losses associated with a warming planet, Green Century led a shareholder advocacy program this year with three of the world’s largest insurers: Chubb*, The Hartford*, and Travelers,* asking each company to phase out the underwriting of new fossil fuel projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our dialogues with each company were informative, but none agreed to phase out new fossil fuel projects. The Green Century Funds filed shareholder resolutions with the companies so that shareholders could weigh in on whether insurers should continue to underwrite some of the activities most directly responsible for warming our planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no climate-related proposals at insurance companies won majority support this shareholder season, Green Century helped the issue gain widespread </span><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/fossil-fuel-insurance-is-turning-into-a-climate-change-fight-whats-at-stake-a3e09ce5" data-wplink-edit="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increased board-level discussion, and heightened investor awareness. Going forward, we’ll build on our momentum to drive forwa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd this long-term program to build a green, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuel-free future for our children and grandchildren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way you can make an impact is to sign </span><a href="https://pirg.org/take-action/tell-insurance-ceos-stop-insuring-climate-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from our nonprofit owners at PIRG urging these three companies to stop insuring climate risks. Fossil fuels won’t go the way of the dinosaur overnight, but sustained pressure from investors, advocates, and everyday people can and will continue to win meaningful policy change in the years to come.</span></p>
