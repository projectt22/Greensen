<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Hasbro*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to full disclosure of its plastic packaging use in 2024 after reaching an agreement with Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>The toy industry is by far the most plastic intensive consumer goods industry in the world.  Revealing plastic use, or disclosure, is a critical first step in reducing plastic pollution, which has nearly quadrupled in the past 20 years, and reducing material risks.</p>
<p>“With this commitment, Hasbro provides the transparency that investors want and need” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Once Hasbro compiles its data, we encourage the company to use it to make stronger commitments to reduce its non-essential single-use plastic.”</p>
<h4><strong>Transparency is a first step towards sustainability</strong></h4>
<p>Plastic waste has passed the crisis stage. Plastic production has grown explosively in the past 60 years, with estimates predicting we will produce nearly 1480 million tons of plastic by 2050.</p>
<p>Of this, only 9% is likely to be recycled. In fact, plastic is more likely to be burned than recycled, with disastrous consequences for children living near incineration facilities. All other plastic results in waste that doesn’t degrade but breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics which pollute our oceans, soil, atmosphere and even our bloodstream.</p>
<p>Green Century has been engaging companies about their plastic use and waste for three years and has secured more than a dozen agreements with companies including Disney,* Costco,* and Mattel*.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, disclosure is about accountability and empowering consumers, managers and investors to make better decisions,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate</strong> with Green Century. “By improving transparency of its plastic use, Hasbro is positioning itself to be a more sustainable company.”<a href="http://www.greencentury.com"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-17909 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png" alt="" width="300" height="88" /></a></p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, <a href="mailto:tpeterson@greencentury.com">asanders@greencentury.com</a>, 773-272-6691</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:mmorgenstein@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 5th, 2023</strong> – One hundred and eighty five investors with $10 trillion in assets under management, including Green Century°, have signed a statement demanding that companies adopt a more radical approach to reducing their reliance on plastics. Specifically, investors urge intensive users of plastic packaging – such as consumer goods companies and grocery retailers from Kellogg* to Costco* – to drastically reduce single-use plastic packaging, implement packaging reuse systems, phase out hazardous chemicals in plastics, and advocate for policies supporting these actions.</p>
<p>“The plastics life cycle not only poses a grave and growing threat to our environment, but the financial burden on society from plastic pollution exceeds $100 billion per year,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “No convenience is worth those costs.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Companies Need to Step Up to Solve the Plastics Problem</strong></span></h3>
<p>The damage caused to the environment from plastics is clear. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/08/plastic-particles-oceans-marine-pollution-production" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Between 75 and 199 million</a> tonnes of plastics have leaked into the ocean, and the total greenhouse gas emissions from single-use plastics in 2021 were equivalent to the <a href="https://cdn.minderoo.org/content/uploads/2023/02/04205527/Plastic-Waste-Makers-Index-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual emissions of the United Kingdom</a>. Yet, according to the <a href="https://packagingeurope.com/news/progress-report-by-ellen-macarthur-foundation-casts-doubt-on-business-full-transition-into-reusable-recyclable-or-compostable-packaging-by-2025/9009.article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a>, most companies will ‘almost certainly’ miss their existing plastics reduction targets, increasing their use of single-use plastic packaging overall and failing to demonstrate credible and ambitious plans for reuse.</p>
<p>“Investors are sending a clear signal that companies must urgently address their contribution to the plastic problem,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Annie Sanders</a>, Director of Shareholder Advocacy at Green Century Capital Management. “With increased regulation, litigation, and changing consumer preferences around plastics, it’s in companies’ best interests to meaningfully address the very real financial risks posed by this crisis.”</p>
<p>The investor letter asks companies to significantly reduce material consumption, eliminate single-use packaging and scale up reusable packaging systems, among other actions. The letter also calls for companies to publicly support – rather than lobby against – ambitious policy on plastic reduction, including the Global Plastics Treaty and the EU’s Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR). A <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/The-Consumer-Products-Sector-and-the-EU-s-Circular-Economy-Policy-for-Packaging-Waste-21189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a> showed that lobbying efforts by industry associations already managed to considerably weaken some of the measures.</p>
