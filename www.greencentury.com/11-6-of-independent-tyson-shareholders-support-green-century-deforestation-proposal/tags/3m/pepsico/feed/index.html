<p><strong>Boston, May 07, 2025</strong> – Shareholders sent a nature-positive message to PepsiCo* on Wednesday in response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century Capital Management. The proposal asked the company to assess its impact on nature and the systemic risks posed to the company by those impacts on the world around us.</p>



<p>“PepsiCo relies on nature for all the ingredients that go into its products, from corn and spices to fresh water,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company needs to do everything possible to ensure it’s not hurting healthy ecosystems. That will help reduce PepsiCo’s potential nature-related risks.”</p>



<p><strong>The natural world under pressure</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwcboosts-global-nature-and-biodiversity-capabilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half of global GDP </a>is dependent on natural inputs. Yet, the reliability of these inputs is increasingly uncertain. The United States incurred more than <a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-20-billion-question-hanging-over-americas-struggling-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 billion in crop losses last year because of extreme weather</a>. In addition, the global decline in pollinators has destabilized crop yields across two-thirds of the world. The <a href="https://octopart.com/pulse/p/extreme-weather-becomes-new-supply-chain-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disruption of nature </a>also impacts the <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transportation systems </a>that companies such as PepsiCo use to bring products to market. In 2024, wildfires, hurricanes and floods <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/weathers-wrath-supply-chains-reel-from-2024s-extreme-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down transport systems around the globe</a>, causing major disruptions in Canada, Mexico, China and Malaysia, among other places.</p>



<p><strong>Investors want transparency re: Pepsi’s impacts on nature</strong></p>



<p>This is the second year that Green Century has offered PepsiCo’s shareholders a proposal on biodiversity impacts. This year’s proposal was supported by 17.7% of PepsiCo shareholders. This vote will allow the resolution to be submitted again next year if the company does not take action. </p>



<p>“We hope that PepsiCo will hear the message of its shareholders: nature matters,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“Investors shouldn’t have to stay up at night wondering whether our company is putting critical ecosystems at risk to sell Doritos and Mountain Dew.”</p>

<p>Andrew Shalit, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:ashalit@greencentury.com">ashalit@greencentury.com</a>, 617-747-4439</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 2, 2024</strong> – Green Century Capital Management<em>° </em>presented its <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/docs/default-source/annual-reports/2024-pepsico-proxy-statement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal for biodiversity and nature reporting </a>at PepsiCo’s annual general meeting on May 1.  In response, approximately 18% of company shareholders voted in favor, bucking a strong push by PepsiCo management against the initiative.</p>
<p>“We’re gratified that a significant number of PepsiCo shareholders stood up for nature,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. “PepsiCo relies on nature for all the products it sells. We hope they hear this clear message from shareholders: the company should account for its reliance on nature, it should disclose its impacts, and it should reduce those impacts wherever possible.”</p>
<p><strong>Strong support leading into the meeting</strong></p>
<p>Ahead of the vote, several large investment groups voiced their support for the proposal, including Norges Bank Investment Management, Allianz Global Investors, and Storebrand Asset Management. The proposal reflects an increased understanding by investors that biodiversity and nature must be considered when evaluating company performance.</p>
<p>“We used to take nature for granted, but we don’t have that luxury anymore,” said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Companies have to ensure their operations have a positive impact on nature. Investors need comprehensive biodiversity reporting through accepted frameworks to have confidence in a company’s behavior.”</p>
<p>Yesterday’s vote was the first time a proposal requesting a comprehensive biodiversity report has been voted on by shareholders of a publicly traded company. Shareholder votes are advisory, and a vote at this level will help ensure the issue stays on the company agenda.</p>

PepsiCo touts itself as an environmentally responsible company, but it does not publish a comprehensive report on its nature-related dependencies, impacts, opportunities, and risks.</p>
<p>“PepsiCo shouldn’t take nature for granted,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “The company depends on nature for the ingredients that go into its snacks and the water that goes into its sodas. It should report clearly and fully on how its operations and sourcing impact nature, and how it can lessen that impact.”</p>

<p><strong>Investors Increasingly Concerned with Nature &amp; Biodiversity</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.natureaction100.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investor concern over nature </a>and biodiversity loss have been on the rise as the planet has experienced increased wildfires, megadroughts, the loss of pollinators, and widespread plastic pollution. The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) announced in January that <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">320 companies </a>had committed to reporting under its framework.</p>
<p>Green Century’s resolution at PepsiCo is among the first asking a company to report under TNFD.  The vote will give an indication of how the broader investment community views this issue.  Several large investment groups have <a href="https://www.responsible-investor.com/investor-heavyweights-to-support-biodiversity-proposal-at-pepsico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signaled their support</a> in advance of the vote, including Allianz Global Investors, Norges Bank Investment Management, the New York City Comptroller, and Storebrand Asset Management.</p>
<p>“Companies in the food and beverage sector are highly reliant on nature and they have a major impact on nature through their sourcing and packaging,” said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “PepsiCo owes investors a full accounting of the risks it faces and the impact it has, and it owes the planet a full assessment of how it can make its supply chain more nature positive.”</p>
<p>PepsiCo’s annual general meeting will be held on May 1<sup>st</sup>.  The result of the vote will be announced in the following days.</p>

<p><b>Boston, April 18, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keurig Dr. Pepper*, a leading global beverage company with brands from Snapple to 7Up, will boost efforts to cut single-use plastic by expanding its “reuse and refill” options across the country. In exchange for its heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction in total plastic packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of plastic flowing into our oceans is on pace to </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20plastic%20trash,to%2029%20million%20metric%20tons." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly triple by 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Keurig Dr. Pepper for stepping up its efforts to address the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keurig Dr. Pepper’s planned actions include expanding its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to include more details on refillable and reusable container pilots. Starting in 2023, the company pledged to publish an annual “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its CSR report. By 2024, the company plans to launch new reuse and refill pilots in key U.S. markets where the local infrastructure and culture are conducive to their success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Keurig Dr. Pepper help build a circular economy by providing more reuse options – from soda cups to K-Cup Pods – in communities across the U.S.”</span></p>
