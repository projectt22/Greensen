<p><strong>Boston, March 13, 2025</strong> &#8212; Sealed Air Corporation*, the packaging company that sells BUBBLE WRAP® and air pillows, will no longer use the “Store Drop-Off&#8221; recycling label on its products by the end of 2025. As part of an agreement with Green Century Capital Management°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, Sealed Air will also disclose its total plastic and fiber footprint by 2026 as well as its investments in non-plastic packaging options. <br><br>“We applaud Sealed Air for investing in plastic alternatives and removing “Store Drop-off” labeling from their products,” said<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>, <strong>President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “To avoid plastic-related risks, companies need to invest in solutions that reduce the tidal wave of plastic entering our oceans every year.”<br><br>The Store Drop-Off label, which features the “chasing arrows” symbol indicating that an item is recyclable, instructs consumers to drop “flexible” plastic packaging, which includes plastic bags, wrappers and film, in bins at local stores for recycling. However, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/target-walmart-recycling-recycle-plastic-bags-abc-news-recyclable/13290905/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media investigations</a> have found that most plastic deposited in these bins ends up in landfills and incinerators. Moreover, a <a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/wcs/recyclinglabels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California law</a> expected to take effect in 2026 prohibits using the chasing arrows symbol or other labeling that makes non-recyclable materials seem recyclable.<br><br>Sealed Air&#8217;s investments in alternatives to plastic packaging will also help the company comply with other regulations, including a <a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/wcs/recyclinglabels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/packaging/packaging-epr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California law</a> that currently requires that all single-use packaging be recyclable by 2032. The company&#8217;s commitment to disclose these investments and its plastic and fiber footprint will help investors understand how its packaging mix evolves over time.<br><br>“Only 9% of plastic waste gets recycled and recycling rates for flexible plastics are even <a href="https://emf.thirdlight.com/file/24/w2e0YaBw2csUih3w2hQ6wcOm1tD/Executive%20Summary%20-%20Flexible%20Packaging%3A%20The%20urgent%20actions%20needed%20to%20deliver%20circular%20economy%20solutions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower</a>,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances </strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fairhead-Stanova</a></strong>, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “With consumers <a href="https://www.packagingdigest.com/sustainability/consumers-want-non-plastic-packaging-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasingly preferring</a> alternatives to plastic packaging for both <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/katie-pelch/new-review-highlights-human-health-risks-microplastic-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">health</a> and environmental reasons, Sealed Air’s commitments to invest in sustainable packaging solutions are both good for business and good for the planet.”</p>
