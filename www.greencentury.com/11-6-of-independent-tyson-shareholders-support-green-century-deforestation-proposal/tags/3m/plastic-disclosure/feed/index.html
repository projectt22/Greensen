					<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, </strong><a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com"><strong>ppodger@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, </strong><a href="mailto:dguernsey@greencentury.com"><strong>dguernsey@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(March 13, Boston, MA) </strong>Marriott International, Inc*, the world’s largest hospitality company, will set a single-use plastic reduction goal by the end of 2025 and disclose a baseline footprint of single-use plastics starting in 2026, thanks to an agreement with Green Century°.</p>
<p>“We welcome Marriott’s commitment to transparency and to cutting its plastic use,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of the Green Century Funds. “Customers, investors, and business leaders value sustainability, so Marriott is taking the right approach to prepare for the future.”</p>
<p>Regulatory and economic pressures have pushed companies to disclose and reduce the use of non-essential single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Marriott has taken steps toward reducing single-use plastic in its operations, including transitioning away from tiny, single-use toiletry bottles to more-sustainable, larger bottles for bath amenities. The bigger bottles are more recyclable and help reduce plastic waste.</p>
<p>“Given Marriott’s scale, with more than 1.5 million hotel rooms worldwide, small changes make massive impacts,” said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “We are pleased that the company is working to create a more sustainable business and planet.”</p>
<p><strong>Plastic Pollution Continues its Explosive Growth</strong></p>
<p>Plastic pollution entering the oceans has been doubling every six years, killing 1 million marine creatures annually. More than 91% of plastics are not recycled.</p>
<p>Experts agree that reducing non-essential single-use plastic is necessary to address the growing plastic pollution crisis.</p>
<p>While some plastic doesn’t have viable alternatives, many single-use applications do.</p>
<p>“Companies first need to understand the scale of the problem and disclose the risks associated with it,” said Guernsey. “Only with reliable information can investors make cogent decisions to reduce the tidal wave of plastic pollution.”</p>
