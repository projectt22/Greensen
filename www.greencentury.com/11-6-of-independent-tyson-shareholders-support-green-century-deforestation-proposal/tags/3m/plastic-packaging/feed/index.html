					<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Hasbro*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to full disclosure of its plastic packaging use in 2024 after reaching an agreement with Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>The toy industry is by far the most plastic intensive consumer goods industry in the world.  Revealing plastic use, or disclosure, is a critical first step in reducing plastic pollution, which has nearly quadrupled in the past 20 years, and reducing material risks.</p>
<p>“With this commitment, Hasbro provides the transparency that investors want and need” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Once Hasbro compiles its data, we encourage the company to use it to make stronger commitments to reduce its non-essential single-use plastic.”</p>
<h4><strong>Transparency is a first step towards sustainability</strong></h4>
<p>Plastic waste has passed the crisis stage. Plastic production has grown explosively in the past 60 years, with estimates predicting we will produce nearly 1480 million tons of plastic by 2050.</p>
<p>Of this, only 9% is likely to be recycled. In fact, plastic is more likely to be burned than recycled, with disastrous consequences for children living near incineration facilities. All other plastic results in waste that doesn’t degrade but breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics which pollute our oceans, soil, atmosphere and even our bloodstream.</p>
<p>Green Century has been engaging companies about their plastic use and waste for three years and has secured more than a dozen agreements with companies including Disney,* Costco,* and Mattel*.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, disclosure is about accountability and empowering consumers, managers and investors to make better decisions,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate</strong> with Green Century. “By improving transparency of its plastic use, Hasbro is positioning itself to be a more sustainable company.”<a href="http://www.greencentury.com"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-17909 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png" alt="" width="300" height="88" /></a></p>

					<h4>Investors concerned over growing evidence of plastic toxicity</h4>
<p>(Boston, MA) Responding to investors’ scrutiny, Keurig Dr Pepper* has expanded its Chemical Management Policy to include forever chemicals PFAS, heavy metals and a family of plastic additives called bisphenols. The move comes after <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/en/2023/05/investors-with-us10-trillion-aum-call-on-corporates-to-drastically-ramp-up-action-on-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">185 investors</a> coordinated by the <a href="https://www.vbdo.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development</a> sent a letter to the company highlighting toxic additives in plastic packaging.</p>
<p>“Plastic packaging can be toxic at every stage of its lifecycle,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate at Green Century° who helped lead the investor engagement. “Thousands of potentially harmful plastic additives have been identified in food packaging. We expect companies to commit to identifying and eliminating the use of hazardous substances and to publicly report on their progress.”</p>
<p>Companies are currently not required to disclose plastic additives to consumers or investors. Of the over <a href="https://ikhapp.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SCEPT_Policy_Brief_chemicals_polymers_of_concern_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">13,000 chemicals added to plastics</a>, nearly 70% are known to be hazardous or have not been assessed for safety.</p>
<p>A growing body of evidence links plastic and its additives to <a href="https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/files/48995/Pete%20Myers%20testimony.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breast cancer, autism, infertility</a>, and other issues through endocrine disruption, which alter critical hormone functions.</p>
<p>Dr. Pete Myers, of the Environmental Health Sciences, speaking at a recent U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=D8583DB7-BFEE-480C-BBE3-AC1DCE04711B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hearing</a> emphasized the risks of endocrine disruption from plastic, stating that no plastic has been thoroughly tested using the tools of modern medical science.</p>
<p><strong>Plastic additives impact plastic recyclability, harm ecosystems, and damage human health.</strong></p>
<p>“We appreciate companies expanding chemical management policies, but it is really a bandage on a broken system,” said Guernsey. “What we need is an absolute reduction of single-use plastic, replaced with tested solutions like reusable bottles and plastic-free packaging.”</p>

					<p>Contact Information:</p>
<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Good news for families looking to shrink their environmental impact this holiday season. Green Century°, one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds in the U.S., filed three shareholder resolutions asking toy companies Disney*, Hasbro* and Mattel* to cut single-use plastic. Not only is excessive plastic packaging unnecessary and wasteful, but toy companies could also increase long-term value by reducing risks from single-use plastics used to package toys.</p>
<p>“Some toys have more plastic packaging than actual toy – it doesn’t make sense fiscally or environmentally,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “There are real business concerns from single-use plastic, ranging from damaged brand reputation from plastic pollution to legal action because of toxicity. A toy&#8217;s packaging shouldn&#8217;t outlive the people who play with it.”</p>
<h5>It is estimated that American’s household waste increases by more than 25% from Thanksgiving to New Years. Much of this waste comes from plastic packaging.</h5>
<p>Excessive plastic packaging is highly visible and unpopular, and governments have increasingly issued taxes and bans on single-use plastic. Companies also face legal risk, as exemplified by New York state suing PepsiCo over river pollution and the multibillion-dollar fines leveled at manufacturers of plastic additive PFAS, commonly known as forever chemicals.</p>
<p>PFAS is one of the many chemicals manufacturers use in plastic packaging. This and other plastic additives, which are often largely unknown even to companies, are a particular concern for the toy industry as children are more susceptible to the effects of environmental toxins.</p>
<p>“Plastic is hurting wildlife in our oceans, and it&#8217;s also hurting us,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “Of the over 13,000 chemicals associated with plastics and plastic production, most have not been studied or are harmful to humans. Companies need to fully disclose their plastic footprints and commit to reducing all non-essential, single-use plastic.”</p>
<p>While investors are examining the growing issue, representatives from the UN are debating a global plastics treaty that could make companies responsible for the waste they create. Experts have stated that the best way to address the growing plastic crisis is to first reduce plastic use and production, particularly for non-essential single-use plastics, which are defined as plastics that are not absolutely necessary, have available alternatives, and have an intended lifespan of one use or less than 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 5th, 2023</strong> – One hundred and eighty five investors with $10 trillion in assets under management, including Green Century°, have signed a statement demanding that companies adopt a more radical approach to reducing their reliance on plastics. Specifically, investors urge intensive users of plastic packaging – such as consumer goods companies and grocery retailers from Kellogg* to Costco* – to drastically reduce single-use plastic packaging, implement packaging reuse systems, phase out hazardous chemicals in plastics, and advocate for policies supporting these actions.</p>
<p>“The plastics life cycle not only poses a grave and growing threat to our environment, but the financial burden on society from plastic pollution exceeds $100 billion per year,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “No convenience is worth those costs.”</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Companies Need to Step Up to Solve the Plastics Problem</strong></span></h3>
<p>The damage caused to the environment from plastics is clear. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/08/plastic-particles-oceans-marine-pollution-production" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Between 75 and 199 million</a> tonnes of plastics have leaked into the ocean, and the total greenhouse gas emissions from single-use plastics in 2021 were equivalent to the <a href="https://cdn.minderoo.org/content/uploads/2023/02/04205527/Plastic-Waste-Makers-Index-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual emissions of the United Kingdom</a>. Yet, according to the <a href="https://packagingeurope.com/news/progress-report-by-ellen-macarthur-foundation-casts-doubt-on-business-full-transition-into-reusable-recyclable-or-compostable-packaging-by-2025/9009.article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a>, most companies will ‘almost certainly’ miss their existing plastics reduction targets, increasing their use of single-use plastic packaging overall and failing to demonstrate credible and ambitious plans for reuse.</p>
<p>“Investors are sending a clear signal that companies must urgently address their contribution to the plastic problem,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Annie Sanders</a>, Director of Shareholder Advocacy at Green Century Capital Management. “With increased regulation, litigation, and changing consumer preferences around plastics, it’s in companies’ best interests to meaningfully address the very real financial risks posed by this crisis.”</p>
<p>The investor letter asks companies to significantly reduce material consumption, eliminate single-use packaging and scale up reusable packaging systems, among other actions. The letter also calls for companies to publicly support – rather than lobby against – ambitious policy on plastic reduction, including the Global Plastics Treaty and the EU’s Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR). A <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/The-Consumer-Products-Sector-and-the-EU-s-Circular-Economy-Policy-for-Packaging-Waste-21189" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a> showed that lobbying efforts by industry associations already managed to considerably weaken some of the measures.</p>

					<p><b>Media Contacts: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Boston, April 18, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keurig Dr. Pepper*, a leading global beverage company with brands from Snapple to 7Up, will boost efforts to cut single-use plastic by expanding its “reuse and refill” options across the country. In exchange for its heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction in total plastic packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of plastic flowing into our oceans is on pace to </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20plastic%20trash,to%2029%20million%20metric%20tons." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly triple by 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Keurig Dr. Pepper for stepping up its efforts to address the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keurig Dr. Pepper’s planned actions include expanding its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to include more details on refillable and reusable container pilots. Starting in 2023, the company pledged to publish an annual “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its CSR report. By 2024, the company plans to launch new reuse and refill pilots in key U.S. markets where the local infrastructure and culture are conducive to their success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Keurig Dr. Pepper help build a circular economy by providing more reuse options – from soda cups to K-Cup Pods – in communities across the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Replacing Single-Use Plastics Effectively</b></span><b><br />
</b><b><br />
</b><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuse and refill models are </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the most effective ways</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to replace single-use plastics. They’re also on the rise, with 2022 bringing major commitments from beverage giants </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-coca-cola-announces-refillable-packaging-goal-prompted-by-proposal-from-green-century-and-as-you-sow/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coca-Cola</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/pepsico-reusable-packaging-51670358630" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PepsiCo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide 25% and 20% of their drinks, respectively, in reusable containers by 2030.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These policies are likely influenced by, among other factors, changing c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsumer attitudes on plastics: a December 2022 survey found that over 80% of registered U.S. voters support requiring companies to increase reusable </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://usa.oceana.org/press-releases/americans-are-sick-of-single-use-plastic-pollution-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packaging and foodware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Companies such as Keurig Dr. Pepper are beginning to realize that an investment in reusable and refillable containers can mitigate the financial, regulatory, and reputational risks posed by single-use plastics,” added Sanders. “They’re also seeing consumers act, in growing numbers, on the common-sense conviction that nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our planet for hundreds of years.”</span></p>

<p><b>Boston, April 17, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Colgate-Palmolive*, a leading global consumer products </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3456/colgate-palmolive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will enhance its efforts to reduce plastic packaging and scale up reuse models that cut down on single-use plastic. In exchange for this heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Capital Management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction of total plastic packaging use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/10/breakingtheplasticwave_mainreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 million tons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of plastic waste is released into the ocean annually, </span><a href="https://conserveturtles.org/information-sea-turtles-threats-marine-debris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killing more than 1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marine animals each year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Colgate-Palmolive for stepping up its efforts to tackle the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Colgate-Palmolive to accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colgate-Palmolive’s planned actions include more thorough disclosure in future sustainability reports of </span><a href="https://www.colgatepalmolive.com/en-us/who-we-are/stories/plastic-commitments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reuse pilots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company has launched or planned, such as refillable jars for toothpaste tablets and Palmolive dish gel sold in refillable bottles. The company also will publish a “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its upcoming 2023 sustainability report and accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction that will prioritize packaging redesign and expansion of reuse and refill models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s clear that we can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Colgate-Palmolive significantly reduce its total contribution to plastic waste as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #008000;">States will make producers responsible for the waste they create</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s focus on plastic reduction comes not a moment too soon: a December 2022 survey found that 84% of registered U.S. voters support increasing the use of reusable packaging and foodware, and 80% support requiring companies to reduce their single-use </span><a href="https://usa.oceana.org/press-releases/americans-are-sick-of-single-use-plastic-pollution-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic packaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Governments are also taking note: since 2021, Maine, Oregon, California and Colorado have adopted the nation’s first producer responsibility laws for consumer packaging, which will make producers financially responsible for the packaging waste they create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our environment for centuries,” added Sanders. “Reuse and refill models, which </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rank among the most effective ways to replace single-use plastics, are critical solutions that companies must urgently scale up to meet one of the most profound environmental challenges of our time.” </span></p>
