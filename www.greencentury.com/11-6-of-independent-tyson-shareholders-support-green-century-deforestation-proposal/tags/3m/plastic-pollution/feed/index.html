<p>Boston, May 2, 2025 &#8212; Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.* (KDP), the retailer of the leading single-serve coffee brewing system in the United States, has agreed to share more information about the recyclability of the plastic K-Cup pods used in its K-Cup brewing system. KDP made this commitment in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>



<p><br>“Investing in more sustainable packaging is a commitment that consumers and investors are increasingly looking for,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Given the reputational and legal risks associated with plastic packaging and misleading recycling labeling, Keurig Dr. Pepper should accelerate its transition to more sustainable options as soon as possible.”</p>



<p><br>KDP has agreed to provide consumers with information on whether their communities accept K-Cup pods for recycling. The company will also make it easier for readers of its sustainability report to understand what it classifies as recyclable. Finally, KDP has agreed to provide more information on the development of its K-Round system, which would make single-serve coffee in compostable, plant-based pods instead of plastic.</p>



<p><br><strong>What does it mean to be recyclable?</strong></p>



<p><br>According to the Federal Trade Commissions’ <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/federal_register_notices/guides-use-environmental-marketing-claims-green-guides/greenguidesfrn.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green Guides</a>, an item is recyclable if it can be “collected, separated, or otherwise recovered from the waste stream through an established recycling program for reuse or use in manufacturing or assembling another item.” In other words, a community must accept it for recycling collection and sufficient end markets must exist to turn the material into recycled plastic.</p>



<p><br>K-Cup pods are made from polypropylene, a material that <a href="https://recyclingpartnership.org/Polypropylene-Recycling-Coalition-Annual-Report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half of Americans can put in their curbside recycling bins</a>. However, far fewer communities accept these pods because they are hard to sort because they are so small. A <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/planet4-usa-stateless/2024/11/7287b658-gpus_finalreport_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Greenpeace report</a> found that only 1 out of the 375 material recovering facilities (MRF’s) included in the study accepted coffee pods made from polypropylene.</p>



<p><br>KDP has faced <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sec-keurig-dr-pepper-recyclability-settlement-coffee-k-pods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits</a> over its recyclability claims and was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fined by the SEC</a> for misleading shareholders about the recyclability of its K-Cup pods. California already regulates recyclability claims made by companies, and a <a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/wcs/recyclinglabels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new law</a> taking effect there in October 2026 that strengthens regulation of recyclability claims.</p>



<p><br>“We hope this move by KDP will make it easier for customers to access information on the recyclability of K-Cup pods in their communities,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century.</strong>. “We encourage the company to provide access to this information directly on its packaging.”</p>

<p>Boston, April 1, 2025 – Starbucks Corporation*, the world’s largest coffee chain, has agreed to disclose more details on its transition to reusable cups and ensure the accuracy of its recycling labels. These commitments came in response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, asking the company to address risks posed by its plastic waste.</p>



<p><br>“Single-use plastics cost the economy up to $120 billion <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/rethinking%20future%20of%20plastics/the%20new%20plastics%20economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every year</a>, making plastic reduction a high priority issue for investors,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We applaud Starbucks for strengthening its efforts to reduce plastic pollution by using more reusable cups and only labeling plastic as recyclable if it is widely recycled in practice.”</p>



<p><br>Starbucks agreed to share actions and plans to increase adoption of reusable cups by early 2026, building on the company’s existing efforts to bring ceramic mugs back to stores as the default option and accept reusable cups for drive-thru and mobile orders in the U.S. and Canada. Starbucks has also agreed to internally assess customer-facing recyclability claims against the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-issues-revised-green-guides/greenguides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTC Green Guides</a> in 2025 and subsequently remove any misleading labels.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reusable Packaging Cuts Plastic Pollution</strong></p>



<p><br>Only 9% of plastic waste globally gets <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycled</a>, while every year approximately <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/2023/11/how-single-use-plastics-hurt-our-oceans-and-warm-our-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33 billion pounds of plastic</a> enters the marine environment. Tiny pieces called microplastics have been found in human bodies and linked to cancer, respiratory disorders and neurological symptoms.</p>



<p><br>Reusable packaging is widely accepted as one of the most <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/rethinking%20future%20of%20plastics/the%20new%20plastics%20economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective ways</a> to avoid plastic waste, reduce costs, and respond to changing consumer preferences: in a recent survey, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72%</a> of respondents believe that companies should reduce their use of single-use plastic.</p>



<p><br>“Starbucks’ efforts to scale up reusable cups and ensure that its recycling labeling is accurate are important steps in the right direction,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/">Frances Fairhead-Stanova</a>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We need more companies to follow Starbucks’ lead and cut plastic waste by investing in reuse systems.”</p>



<p><br>According to the FTC Green Guides, a product or package should only be marketed as recyclable if the necessary infrastructure exists to recycle it. Most plastics do not meet this standard, making plastic reduction and reuse systems key to alleviating the plastic pollution crisis.</p>

<p><br><strong>Boston, March 20, 2025</strong> – Coca-Cola, the largest soft drink company in the world, has committed to disclosing its ongoing investments in reusable bottles and the outcomes of these efforts. The company took this action in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>



<p><br>Coca-Cola sells beverages in more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherfarmbrough/2019/03/15/coca-cola-reveals-it-produces-3m-tonnes-of-plastic-packaging-a-year-in-ground-breaking-report/?sh=315b871e670f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 billion plastic bottles</a> a year and is the world’s <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2024/02/07/bffp-movement-unveils-2023-global-brand-audit-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest plastic polluter</a>. However, the company recently reneged on its goals to deliver 25% of beverages in reusable containers by 2030 and to cut 3 million metric tons of new plastic by 2025.</p>



<p><br>“Though Coca-Cola regrettably abandoned its plastic reduction and reuse goals, this new commitment to disclosing reusable packaging investments and results will help investors track the company’s efforts to mitigate plastic-related risks,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>,<strong> president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “With plastic pollution <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubling every six years</a> and less than <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-much-plastic-gets-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of it</a> getting recycled, it’s clear that reuse and reduction are key.”</p>



<p><br>According to experts, one of the most effective ways to <a href="https://emf.thirdlight.com/file/24/sjZ_pROsjk8VSKPsjXVEszMGHY/Unlocking%20a%20reuse%20revolution%20-%20scaling%20returnable%20packaging.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce both plastic use and plastic pollution</a> is by replacing single-use plastic containers with reusable ones. Reusable packaging is good for business, too. Studies show that <a href="https://www.greensportsalliance.org/playbooks/reuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumers want</a> companies to give them more reusable packaging options.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reuse Disclosure Necessary to Track Coca-Cola’s Efforts to Reduce Single-Use Plastic</strong></p>



<p><br>When Coca-Cola dropped its reuse goal in late 2024, the beverage giant stated that it plans to expand its use of reusable packaging in markets where existing infrastructure can support this important part of its portfolio. Coca-Cola reported that 14% of its beverages were sold in reusable containers <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/content/dam/company/us/en/reports/2023-environmental-update/2023-environmental-update.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in both 2022 and 2023</a>, but that the share of Coca-Cola beverages sold in reusable glass bottles <a href="https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1128/coca-cola-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased in 2024</a>.</p>



<p><br>“We will be monitoring Coca-Cola’s disclosure on how it is investing in reusables and how this translates into more beverages sold in reusable packaging,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a>, <strong>shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “At the end of the day, investors need these disclosures to ensure Coca-Cola is mitigating the regulatory, reputational and systemic risks posed by its role in the plastic pollution crisis.”</p>



<p><br>Plastic production is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/plastic-consumption-course-nearly-double-by-2050-research-2023-02-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on pace to double by 2050</a> without meaningful action to reduce it &#8211; and companies like Coca-Cola can make an outsized impact. Already, the equivalent of <a href="https://www.unep.org/plastic-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic</a> end up in our oceans, rivers and lakes every day. Studies show that microplastics are <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/02/how-microplastics-get-into-the-food-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polluting the human body</a>, too, and have been linked to serious health impacts.</p>

<p><strong>Boston, March 13, 2025</strong> &#8212; Sealed Air Corporation*, the packaging company that sells BUBBLE WRAP® and air pillows, will no longer use the “Store Drop-Off&#8221; recycling label on its products by the end of 2025. As part of an agreement with Green Century Capital Management°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, Sealed Air will also disclose its total plastic and fiber footprint by 2026 as well as its investments in non-plastic packaging options. <br><br>“We applaud Sealed Air for investing in plastic alternatives and removing “Store Drop-off” labeling from their products,” said<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>, <strong>President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “To avoid plastic-related risks, companies need to invest in solutions that reduce the tidal wave of plastic entering our oceans every year.”<br><br>The Store Drop-Off label, which features the “chasing arrows” symbol indicating that an item is recyclable, instructs consumers to drop “flexible” plastic packaging, which includes plastic bags, wrappers and film, in bins at local stores for recycling.

<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>9. Pressing tech companies to curb emissions.</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>While IBM* has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-31-of-ibm-shareholders-support-green-century-climate-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</a></p>

Other mutual funds in the responsible investing space had followed Green Century’s lead but now are backtracking. You can count on Green Century to remain steadfast in its opposition to coal, oil, gas and other environmentally dangerous industries including nuclear power. </span></p>

<p><strong>BOSTON, September 24, 2024 – </strong>A noteworthy 40% of General Mills shareholders voted Tuesday in favor of a Green Century° proposal urging the food company to assess how it can increase the scale, pace and rigor of its sustainability efforts, including reducing plastic packaging. The proposal also urged General Mills to ensure its recycling labels don’t mislead consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plastic pollution is harming our oceans, our wildlife, and our health,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century</strong> <strong>Funds</strong>. “General Mills’ investors have sent a strong message that the company cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution problem.” </p>



<p>The ocean ingests enough plastic every minute to fill a garbage truck, and global plastic consumption is on track to double by <a href="https://environmentenergyleader.com/stories/ocean-floor-polluted-with-11-million-tons-of-plastic-new-research-finds,1328#:~:text=Ocean%20Floor%20Polluted%20with%2011%20Million%20Tons%20of%20Plastic%2C%20New%20Research%20Finds,-Photo%20by%20Naja&amp;text=Recent%20research%20spearheaded%20by%20Australia&#039;s,reside%20on%20the%20ocean%20floor." target="_blank" rel="noopener">2040</a>. Though industry often elevates recycling as the solution to global plastic pollution, experts say reducing plastic use is <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/turning-off-tap-end-plastic-pollution-create-circular-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Green Century filed a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/general-mills-shareholders-call-for-less-plastic-packaging-over-55-of-voting-shareholders-opt-for-green-century-proposal/">similar proposal</a> two years ago asking General Mills to assess how it could cut its plastic use. That resolution received 56% of shareholder votes cast – one of the few majority votes on environmental issues in the 2022-2023 U.S. proxy season. Although General Mills has since enhanced some plastics-related disclosures, it neither issued the requested report nor disclosed substantive approaches, targets or plans to reduce its plastic <a href="https://globalresponsibility.generalmills.com/HTML1/general_mills-global_responsibility_2024_0054.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packaging</a>. Instead, the company doubled down on its goal to design 100% of packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030 &#8212; even though most plastic is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/24/1131131088/recycling-plastic-is-practically-impossible-and-the-problem-is-getting-worse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not feasibly recyclable</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recycling labels for plastic have come under scrutiny in recent years. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-09-29/us-store-drop-off-plastic-recycling-often-ends-up-in-landfills?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2023 article</a> by Bloomberg showed that General Mills’ Nature Valley Granola Bar wrappers are not being recycled through “store drop-off” but are instead being landfilled, incinerated or exported. An <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/abcnews.go.com/US/put-dozens-trackers-plastic-bags-recycling-trashed/story?id=99509422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC investigation</a> in May 2023 highlighted the failure of store drop-off systems to recycle plastic bags and films. Other large food companies such as Mondelez have recognized these risks and committed to <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/packaging-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce</a> plastic packaging and remove “store drop-off” and “check locally” recycling logos by <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/esg-topics/recyclability-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“General Mills’ emphasis on plastic recyclability over plastic reduction is misleading and ineffective,” said Annie Sanders, Green Century’s director of shareholder advocacy. “At the end of the day, General Mills needs to do right by its shareholders and the world around them. And the message from shareholders is clear: It’s time to reduce plastic pollution.”&nbsp;</p>

					<p><strong>BOSTON &#8212; </strong>VF Corporation*, the parent company of <em>The </em><em>North Face</em><em>®,</em><em> Vans</em><em>®</em>, and <em>Timberland</em><em>®</em> brands, will take steps to further address microfiber pollution from its clothes after engagement with Green Century° and As You Sow. The company has joined the “<a href="https://www.microfibreconsortium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Microfibre Consortium</a>” at the enterprise level where it will collaborate with industry leaders to develop plans to improve testing, research, and data on microfiber pollution.</p>
<p>Also known as fiber shedding, microfiber pollution results from the manufacture and washing of clothes, which release tiny fiber threads. Microfiber pollution is particularly concerning for synthetic textiles, like polyester and acrylic.</p>
<p>Synthetic textiles produce an estimated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/reduce-laundry-microfiber-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35%</a> of the microplastic pollution in the world’s oceans.</p>
<p>“Clothes made from synthetic materials release thousands of microplastics with each wash and pollute our waterways,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Companies should tell consumers which of their products produce high amounts of microfiber pollution and reduce microfiber pollution in their supply chains.”</p>
<p>Textiles are the third-largest market for plastics and consume nearly 15% of total plastic <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/NOAA-NOS-2022-0061-0002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">production</a>.</p>
<p>The Microfibre Consortium is working with policymakers, suppliers and brands to reduce the environmental impacts of Microfiber pollution. The organization is creating a rating system for textiles, which is anticipated to launch in 2025.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that the company has agreed to consider setting a companywide microfiber shedding reduction goal after the consortium rating system is completed,” <strong>said Conrad MacKerron, Senior Vice President, As You Sow</strong>.</p>
<p>Regulation on Microfiber pollution is likely to increase. An “<a href="https://docs.score-environnemental.com/v/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eco-Score</a>” system in France will use microfiber pollution as one of the metrics for scoring clothing sustainability. One competitor, Under Armour, has already committed to transition to more <a href="https://about.underarmour.com/en/stories/2023/02/under-armour-announces-new-methodology-to-measure-fiber-shedding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Low shed” materials by 2030.</a></p>
<p>“We encourage all clothing companies to disclose more information about which of their products are likely to shed microfibers,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “Consumers want to make informed decisions, but that isn’t possible if they don’t have access to basic information.”</p>

					<p><strong>Boston, March 28, 2024 – </strong>For the second consecutive year<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-100-most-influential-women-in-u-s-finance-leslie-samuelrich-28260343?mod=B100womenprofile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a><strong><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/barrons-100-most-influential-women-in-u-s-finance-leslie-samuelrich-28260343?mod=B100womenprofile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds°</a>, </strong>was named to <strong><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/most-influential-women-in-finance-b881e105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barron’s 100 Most Influential Women in U.S. Finance</a></strong>, joining a corps of noteworthy women in government, technology, banking and financial powerhouses.</p>
<p>Leslie has been a vocal and active leader, promoting environmentally and sustainable investing for the past 10 years at the helm of Green Century. She and others have taken various paths into leadership roles on <a href="https://www.barrons.com/women-in-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barron’s fifth annual list</a>.</p>
<p>From money managers to risk officers, she joins financial leaders at the National Economic Council, U.S. Commerce Department, Nvidia, and other senior leadership positions in the private, nonprofit, and public sectors. Samuelrich is one of a few women honored on the list to work in the responsible investing field. The list of women, all based in the U.S., is <a href="https://www.barrons.com/women-in-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chosen by a panel of Barron’s writers and editors, and is based on external and internal nominations, according to Barron’s</a>.</p>
<p>“I am truly honored to be chosen again to join these influential and groundbreaking women in finance,” she said. “At Green Century, we help individuals genuinely align their investments with their values by keeping their money out of environmentally harmful industries such as fossil fuels, tobacco, and factory farming. We also flex our power as shareholders and successfully get companies to cut carbon footprints, plastic pollution, and protect nature. We work with about 100 companies each year to bring about change and hold them accountable.”</p>
<p>After majoring in economics at Boston College<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">, Samuelrich gained more than 25 years</a> of experience in corporate engagement and environmental and public health advocacy. Her comments have appeared in The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Reuters, Barron’s, Morningstar, the New York Times, and many other outlets. She was named to InsideClimate News‘  inaugural list of Climate Action 30 in 2022 and completed two terms on the Board of Directors of the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (US SIF).</p>
<p><strong>Samuelrich A Leader in Green Investing</strong></p>
<p>She has attracted attention for her ability to take strong positions and educate the public and financial advisors about greenwashing, ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria, divestment, engagement, and other practices. &#8220;We’re proud of our leadership in fossil fuel free investing, driving a cutting-edge shareholder engagement program, and exposing greenwashing in the field,” she said.</p>
<p>The Green Century Funds have experienced a183 percent growth under her decade-long leadership and her efforts help align people’s investments with their values.</p>
<p>The Green Century Funds are one of the pioneers of fossil fuel free mutual funds with about $1.2 billion in managed assets. Green Century Capital Management is the investment advisor to the Green Century Funds and is owned by nine Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs), nonprofits that advocate for environmental and public health issues. This unique ownership structure means that every dollar Green Century earns managing its Funds can support those nonprofit organizations and their critical work to protect the environment and public health policies.</p>

					<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Choice Hotels International*, one of the world&#8217;s leading lodging franchisors, has agreed to take the first step in addressing plastic pollution by conducting a program measure single-use plastic and develop strategies for single-use plastic reduction after engagement by Green Century°.</p>
<p>Choice Hotels, which has a diverse portfolio of 22 brands including Comfort Inn, Cambria Hotels, and Econo Lodge, will conduct a plastics reduction inventory program in 2024 and use it to set a new goal to reduce single-use plastic next year.</p>
<p>“As investors learn that plastic used for a minute can pollute our environment for hundreds of years, it has become a risk that companies need to manage,” said<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"> Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</a>. “We welcome Choice Hotel’s move to set a new plastic reduction goal.”</p>
<h4><strong>Choice Hotels, On of The Leading Lodging Franchisors, Agrees to Single-Use Plastic Study, Reduction</strong></h4>
<p>Choice Hotel’s commitment comes as consumers, investors, and regulators increasingly focus on the negative impacts of single-use plastic on the planet. According to a recent survey, 80% of U.S. respondents from across the political spectrum support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic.</p>
<p>“Delighting guests and reducing single-use plastics are clearly compatible,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</a>. “Customers want hospitality that doesn’t compromise the beauty of the places they might have traveled thousands of miles to visit.”</p>
<h4>It is estimated that two garbage trucks worth of plastic enter the ocean every minute.</h4>
<p>Recycling, long touted as the solution to the plastic waste crisis, has resulted in only 9% of plastic being recycled. Scientists and experts agree that the best way to reduce plastic pollution is to cut the amount of plastic companies are producing, and to replace non-essential single-use plastic with tested alternatives like reuseable containers.</p>
<p>“Choice is taking the first steps in addressing plastic pollution by better understanding how and how much plastic is used for its hotels,” added Guernsey. “The next step is to implement reductions, which will return long term value to consumers, the business, and investors.&#8221;</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> The Walt Disney Company* has agreed to disclose how much plastic it’s using in certain areas of its business and to set an additional plastic reduction goal, thanks to an agreement with Green Century Funds°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund. The Walt Disney Company will release its disclosures in 2025 and will publish the additional plastic reduction goal the following year. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<h4><span data-contrast="auto">The new commitments come as regulatory and economic pressures have pushed companies to disclose and reduce the use of non-essential single-use plastic.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It’s crucial that investors know how a company is addressing its environmental risks and Walt Disney’s commitment will provide important information through its new reporting,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</strong>. “It’s a win for the company since single-use plastic is widely unpopular with consumers who recognize that plastics will pollute our environment for generations to come.”  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Disney had previously taken significant steps towards reducing single-use plastic, including committing to eliminate single-use plastic on cruise ships by 2025, introducing plastic free packaging, and by committing to achieve zero waste to landfill for its wholly owned and operated parks and resorts by 2030.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These new commitments to disclose and to reduce unnecessary plastic will increase transparency and better position the company for a more sustainable future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“The green bottom line is that reducing plastic waste is a win for businesses and for the planet,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “Green Century is excited that the company is committed to these transparency measures that investors will value.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Plastic waste is one of the most durable and growing forms of pollution. It is estimated that every piece of plastic produced in the last 60 years that hasn’t been burned is still in the environment. According to a report from PEW Charitable Trust, if current plastic use trends continue, the amount of plastic leaking into oceans will triple, and the amount of plastic in the oceans will quadruple by 2040. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While many methods will be needed to reduce plastic pollution, recommendations from scientists and experts are for an absolute reduction of single-use plastic. Current recycling methods have resulted in only 9% of plastics being recycled, while most plastics labeled with the chasing arrow label are not actually recyclable. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Alternatives to non-essential single-use plastic already exist,” said Guernsey. “From refillable and reusable containers to recycled paper, corporations have options to reduce risk in this sector. Frankly, much of the single-use plastic we use is like the name states – non-essential.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
