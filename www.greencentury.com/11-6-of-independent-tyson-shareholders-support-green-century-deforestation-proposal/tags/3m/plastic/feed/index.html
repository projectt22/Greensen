										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This month has been dubbed <a href="https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plastic Free July</a> and you may have read articles this year about people trying to live <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/26/nx-s1-5021546/plastic-free-sustainable-living-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/12/my-no-plastic-life-i-tried-to-cut-out-single-use-items-for-a-month-and-it-almost-broke-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic</a> for a week – and finding out that it’s all but impossible. Single-use plastics are everywhere. Why is that a problem and what can be done about it?<br></p>



<p><strong>1. What is the problem with plastic?</strong></p>



<p><br>Plastic pollution is everywhere, from the 36,000-foot-deep <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plastic-bag-found-bottom-worlds-deepest-ocean-trench/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mariana Trench</a>&nbsp; to the peak of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount Everest</a>. And plastic is not just polluting places, it’s polluting the bodies of animals too, including humans. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/climate/seabirds-plastic-contamination-crunchy-australia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">778 pieces of plastic were found in the body of one seabird</a>.</p>



<p>Microplastics are now found throughout the human body and levels are especially concentrated in the brain. Adding to the concern, recent studies have found that <a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-human-brains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accumulation of plastic in the brain</a> is growing in parallel with plastic waste in the environment, while according to the Pew Charitable Trust, if business as usual continues, plastic flows into oceans will <a href="https://www.pew.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triple by 2040</a>.</p>



<p><br><strong>2. What is the solution?</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Reduce!</strong> Step one: we need to use WAY less single-use plastic. We can do this by eliminating unnecessary plastic or substituting it for less harmful material like fiber.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reuse! </strong>Reusable packaging can either be made of plastic or other materials. In this case, instead of using the packaging once, it can be used, sanitized, and used again. Think Coca-Cola bottles. In many countries, including parts of Europe and South America, Coca-Cola sells its products in bottles that are used again and again, instead of using a bottle once and throwing it out. Refillable glass bottles can be <a href="https://upstreamsolutions.org/blog/nre-bottle-refill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reused about 50 times</a>!</p>



<p><br><strong>Recycle! </strong>Although most plastics are not widely recycled, recycling also plays a role in reducing plastic use. Companies are reducing their use of virgin plastic by using more recycled plastic.</p>



<p><br><strong>3. Can’t we just recycle our way out of this problem?</strong></p>



<p><br>No. While paper and metals are highly recyclable materials that can be recycled over and over again, it is harder to recycle plastic and as a result the recycling rate for plastic is only about <a href="https://stories.undp.org/why-arent-we-recycling-more-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9%</a>. Additionally, recycling plastic actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/recycled-plastic-more-toxic-no-fix-pollution-greenpeace-warns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases health risks</a> by exposing local communities to toxic air emissions and increasing the toxicity of the plastic itself.</p>



<p><br><strong>4. So, what can you do?</strong></p>



<p>The good news is that there is a LOT we can do to reduce our use of plastic to protect the planet and our health. Here are some things individuals can do:</p>



<ul>
<li>Choose products that have less or no plastic packaging</li>



<li>Buy “used” rather than “new” when you can – whether it’s thrifting (yes, clothes contain plastic!) or toys for your kids, keeping new material out of the waste stream drives down demand for new plastic.</li>



<li>Tell the stores you shop at that you want to buy products without plastic packaging or that have reusable or refillable packaging.</li>



<li><a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/resources/how-young-environmentalists-can-help-tackle-the-plastic-pollution-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kids can protect the environment from plastic too</a>!</li>



<li>Urge your representatives to support effective legislation to cut plastic, including:<ul><li><a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/extended-producer-responsibility/epr-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extended producer responsibility</a> (EPR) laws, which make companies pay for the plastic waste they create;</li></ul><ul><li>Bottle bills, which pay customers to bring back bottles and have been shown to increase recycling rates;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Plastics bag bans, which have also been found to significantly <a href="https://grist.org/science/plastic-bag-ban-beach-cleanups-ocean-conservancy-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce the amount of plastic bags found in the environment</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><br>And if you’re a corporation that uses plastic, you can: reduce, reuse, recycle – in that order!</p>



<ul>
<li>First, make sure that you are only using essential plastic packaging.</li>



<li>Then, offer products in reusable packaging where appropriate.</li>



<li>Finally, for cases where you cannot eliminate or reuse the packaging, use packaging that is made from recycled plastic material.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br>What is Green Century doing about plastics?</strong></p>



<p>As the manager of the Green Century Funds, Green Century Capital Management engages companies with large plastic footprints to press them to reduce their use of plastic. For example, Green Century convinced hotel chains Marriott, Hilton, and Choice Hotels to <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/why-are-big-brands-reducing-plastic/">reduce their use of single use plastics</a>. Because most plastic ends up in landfills and incinerators, we also engage with companies to make sure their recyclability claims don’t mislead consumers. For example, we got Starbucks to commit to ensure that its plastic <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/starbucks-to-expand-disclosure-on-reuse-assess-plastic-recyclability-labels/">recyclability labels</a> are accurate.</p>



<p><br><strong>Is this problem going to get solved?</strong></p>



<p><br>It is not all doom and gloom. A UNEP report found that we can <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/42277/Plastic_pollution.pdf?sequence=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce global plastic pollution by 80%</a> by 2040 – but collective action is key. 175 nations will meet in Geneva, Switzerland in August 2025 to negotiate a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02064-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global plastics treaty</a>. Our elected representatives in states across the country can and have passed laws that reduce plastic. Companies can act quickly on this, at the urging of investors, customers, and civil society organizations. We can turn this ship around, but we all need to get rowing in the same direction. Green Century will continue to push companies to cut plastic and build a truly circular economy on the one planet we’ve got.</p>

								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					
<p></p>



<p>Boston, June 19, 2025 – Amcor*, one of the largest plastic packaging companies in the world, has agreed to assess whether its recycled content claims create financial risks for the company, and if so, to take corrective action. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, which withdrew the proposal in exchange for Amcor’s commitment.</p>



<p><br>“We applaud Amcor for taking steps to ensure its recycled content claims aren’t misleading,” <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>, <strong>President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Investors need comprehensive and transparent disclosure of business risks in order to protect their investments.”</p>



<p><br><strong>Recycled content is good – but ‘mass balance accounting’ obscures the facts</strong></p>



<p><br>The use of recycled content in packaging is a key way to prevent new plastic from entering the environment. However, some companies, including Amcor, use a method called “mass balance accounting” to calculate recycled content. This alternative method can be used by companies to <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/renee-sharp/plastics-industrys-latest-deception-mass-balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim that a majority of a piece of packaging is made from recycled content</a> in cases when traditional accounting methods would put that number at less than 10%. Consequently, mass balance accounting is potentially misleading to consumers, which can create compliance risks for companies since misleading environmental claims are illegal in the <a href="https://earth.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-eus-new-greenwashing-directive/#:~:text=The%20legislation%20explicitly%20prohibits%20companies,respect%20of%20their%20environmental%20commitments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Union</a>, the <a href="https://www.novata.com/resources/blog/regulatory-update-uk-sdr-anti-greenwashing-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://competition-bureau.canada.ca/en/how-we-foster-competition/education-and-outreach/environmental-claims-and-greenwashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> and <a href="https://www.steptoe.com/a/web/195909/NavigatingFTCGuidance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five U.S. states</a>.</p>



<p><br><strong>Effective solutions for plastics</strong></p>



<p><br>Companies use mass balance recycled content claims, in part, because <a href="https://repurpose.global/blog/post/consumers-are-driving-action-on-plastic-waste#:~:text=Ocean%20pollution%20is%20the%20most%20pressing%20environmental%20issue%20for%20younger%20generations.&amp;text=Around%204%20in%205%20(83,if%20they%20don&#039;t%20recycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumers increasingly</a> are concerned about plastic. <a href="https://www.surfrider.org/initiatives/plastic-pollution#:~:text=An%20estimated%2011%20million%20tons,currently%20doubling%20every%20six%20years" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plastic pollution has been doubling</a> every six years in our world’s oceans, where it kills thousands of marine animals every year. Scientists have also linked plastic to human health problems.</p>



<p><br>Amcor has taken some action to reduce risks from its large plastic footprint. It offers paper-based alternatives to plastic in its <a href="https://www.amcor.com/products/materials/paper-packaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amfiber</a> product line and discloses how much plastic it uses. Unlike many peers, Amcor also participates in the <a href="https://www.businessforplasticstreaty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty</a>, an industry group that publicly supports the development of an ambitious, legally binding plastics treaty.</p>



<p><br>“We encourage Amcor to expand on effective solutions that meaningfully address risks associated with its plastic footprint,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “It’s good for business and good for the planet.”</p>

<p>Boston, June 5, 2025 – 5.8% of Walmart* shareholder votes were cast in favor of a Green Century° proposal urging the company to assess how it can increase the scale, pace and rigor of its sustainable packaging efforts. In part, the proposal urged Walmart to reduce its plastic packaging and ensure its recycling labels don’t mislead consumers.</p>



<p><br>“Plastic pollution is harming our oceans, our wildlife and our health,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>.. “Walmart’s investors have sent a message that the company cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution problem. It’s a material risk that concerns investors.”</p>



<p><br>The UN Environment Programme estimates that the social and environmental <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/42277/Plastic_pollution.pdf?sequence=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs of plastic pollution</a> are between $300 and 600 billion dollars per year. This includes costs to human health, the costs of ocean clean-ups and lost marine ecosystem services such as food production and recreation. Although recycling has often been elevated as the solution to global plastic pollution, experts agree it is reducing plastic use that is key.</p>



<p><br>Walmart set a <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/purpose/esgreport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal to reduce its use of virgin plastic</a> in its private brand packaging by 15% by 2025 from 2020 levels, but as of 2023, its use of virgin plastic for private brand packaging had increased by 6%.</p>



<p><br>Studies show that consumers increasingly want to be offered products in reusable packaging, and that reusable packaging is one of the most <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/tipping-point-year-for-reusable-packaging-systems/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20United%20Nations,into%20the%20environment%20by%202040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective ways to reduce plastic pollution</a>. However, Walmart does not disclose information about reusable packaging initiatives in its <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/purpose/esgreport/environmental/waste-circular-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainability report</a>.</p>



<p><br>Beyond failing to disclose effective strategies to reduce its use of plastic packaging, Walmart uses labels with misleading recyclability claims on its plastic packaging, including the “Store Drop Off” label. According to investigations conducted by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-09-29/us-store-drop-off-plastic-recycling-often-ends-up-in-landfills?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/abcnews.go.com/US/put-dozens-trackers-plastic-bags-recycling-trashed/story?id=99509422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC</a>, the majority of plastic bags and films deposited in “Store Drop Off bins” are sent to landfills or incinerated, not recycled. As a result, some major brands such as <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/esg-topics/recyclability-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mondelez</a> have publicly committed to stop using the “Store Drop Off” label while <a href="https://grist.org/accountability/amazon-says-its-plastic-packaging-can-be-recycled-an-investigation-finds-it-usually-isnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other brands</a> have quietly stopped using it.</p>



<p><br>“Without action from companies such as Walmart, the impacts of plastic on our environment and the risks to human health will only increase,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “Investors understand this and have sent a clear message to Walmart: It is time to stop messing around with labels and reduce plastic pollution.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, March 13, 2025</strong> &#8212; Sealed Air Corporation*, the packaging company that sells BUBBLE WRAP® and air pillows, will no longer use the “Store Drop-Off&#8221; recycling label on its products by the end of 2025. As part of an agreement with Green Century Capital Management°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, Sealed Air will also disclose its total plastic and fiber footprint by 2026 as well as its investments in non-plastic packaging options. <br><br>“We applaud Sealed Air for investing in plastic alternatives and removing “Store Drop-off” labeling from their products,” said<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>, <strong>President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “To avoid plastic-related risks, companies need to invest in solutions that reduce the tidal wave of plastic entering our oceans every year.”<br><br>The Store Drop-Off label, which features the “chasing arrows” symbol indicating that an item is recyclable, instructs consumers to drop “flexible” plastic packaging, which includes plastic bags, wrappers and film, in bins at local stores for recycling. However, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/target-walmart-recycling-recycle-plastic-bags-abc-news-recyclable/13290905/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media investigations</a> have found that most plastic deposited in these bins ends up in landfills and incinerators. Moreover, a <a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/wcs/recyclinglabels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California law</a> expected to take effect in 2026 prohibits using the chasing arrows symbol or other labeling that makes non-recyclable materials seem recyclable.<br><br>Sealed Air&#8217;s investments in alternatives to plastic packaging will also help the company comply with other regulations, including a <a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/wcs/recyclinglabels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/packaging/packaging-epr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California law</a> that currently requires that all single-use packaging be recyclable by 2032. The company&#8217;s commitment to disclose these investments and its plastic and fiber footprint will help investors understand how its packaging mix evolves over time.<br><br>“Only 9% of plastic waste gets recycled and recycling rates for flexible plastics are even <a href="https://emf.thirdlight.com/file/24/w2e0YaBw2csUih3w2hQ6wcOm1tD/Executive%20Summary%20-%20Flexible%20Packaging%3A%20The%20urgent%20actions%20needed%20to%20deliver%20circular%20economy%20solutions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lower</a>,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances </strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fairhead-Stanova</a></strong>, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “With consumers <a href="https://www.packagingdigest.com/sustainability/consumers-want-non-plastic-packaging-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasingly preferring</a> alternatives to plastic packaging for both <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/katie-pelch/new-review-highlights-human-health-risks-microplastic-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">health</a> and environmental reasons, Sealed Air’s commitments to invest in sustainable packaging solutions are both good for business and good for the planet.”</p>

<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>10. Protecting rare Right Whales</strong><span style="font-size: 17.897px;"><br></span>Green Century° works on an array of environmental issues, including helping protect the imperiled North Atlantic Right Whale. Our partners at <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/take-action/tell-president-biden-save-right-whales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environment America</a> have been educating the public on how these rare whales are subject to injuries from fishing gear, strikes from vessels, plastic debris, and warming ocean temperatures. Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">Giovanna Eichner found the prospect of effecting change at companies as a worthy and compelling endeavor, so she jumped at a chance to join Green Century° in August as a shareholder advocate.<br><br>Green Century’s award-winning shareholder advocacy team of four people uses the Green Century’s stake as a shareholder to convince companies to change practices for the health of our planet. The team has won victories in a broad swath of issues and industries, including commitments to cut plastics use, protect forests, and reduce carbon footprints.<br><br>The David vs. Goliath dynamic reminded Giovanna of her environmental advocacy efforts at Boston College, where her student government helped convince the college to improve its environmental practices. Their efforts ranged from increasing funding for composting to cutting food waste.<br>“At Green Century, I saw a similar dynamic at play with advocacy and bigger institutions. I was really excited about pursuing climate policies in a way that was advantageous to both,” she said. “I think shareholder advocacy combines both of those elements and really values it.”<br><br><img decoding="async" width="301" height="226" class="wp-image-23532" style="width: 301px;" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg 2420w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1536x1153.jpeg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-2048x1537.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><br><br>Giovanna said she works on climate issues across a dozen industries, ranging from footwear and apparel to insurance and fast-food restaurants. The companies she negotiates with are mostly big-name brands and are in industries that are high carbon emitters. She said Green Century’s strategy also resonated with her.<br><br>“Green Century’s approach is one where you’re looking to make the case to a big institution in a way that benefits them. You must understand and empathize with the other side and convince them that our values are aligned. That is how you get them to buy in!”<br><br>A Somerville resident, Giovanna looks forward to a chance to connect with people who work at Green Century’s nonprofit owners and partners that own the mutual fund firm on campaigns that overlap, and that helps amplify the impact of Funds investors.<br><br>“The nonprofit ownership really stood out to me,” she said. “It shows how Green Century aligns investments with its values by taking all its net profits back to ownership. I also see how collaboration extends beyond financing – there is potential for teamwork on <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">Right to Repair</a>, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">plastics</a> and other issues.

<p><strong>BOSTON, September 24, 2024 – </strong>A noteworthy 40% of General Mills shareholders voted Tuesday in favor of a Green Century° proposal urging the food company to assess how it can increase the scale, pace and rigor of its sustainability efforts, including reducing plastic packaging. The proposal also urged General Mills to ensure its recycling labels don’t mislead consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plastic pollution is harming our oceans, our wildlife, and our health,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century</strong> <strong>Funds</strong>. “General Mills’ investors have sent a strong message that the company cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution problem.” </p>



<p>The ocean ingests enough plastic every minute to fill a garbage truck, and global plastic consumption is on track to double by <a href="https://environmentenergyleader.com/stories/ocean-floor-polluted-with-11-million-tons-of-plastic-new-research-finds,1328#:~:text=Ocean%20Floor%20Polluted%20with%2011%20Million%20Tons%20of%20Plastic%2C%20New%20Research%20Finds,-Photo%20by%20Naja&amp;text=Recent%20research%20spearheaded%20by%20Australia&#039;s,reside%20on%20the%20ocean%20floor." target="_blank" rel="noopener">2040</a>. Though industry often elevates recycling as the solution to global plastic pollution, experts say reducing plastic use is <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/turning-off-tap-end-plastic-pollution-create-circular-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Green Century filed a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/general-mills-shareholders-call-for-less-plastic-packaging-over-55-of-voting-shareholders-opt-for-green-century-proposal/">similar proposal</a> two years ago asking General Mills to assess how it could cut its plastic use. That resolution received 56% of shareholder votes cast – one of the few majority votes on environmental issues in the 2022-2023 U.S. proxy season. Although General Mills has since enhanced some plastics-related disclosures, it neither issued the requested report nor disclosed substantive approaches, targets or plans to reduce its plastic <a href="https://globalresponsibility.generalmills.com/HTML1/general_mills-global_responsibility_2024_0054.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packaging</a>. Instead, the company doubled down on its goal to design 100% of packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030 &#8212; even though most plastic is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/24/1131131088/recycling-plastic-is-practically-impossible-and-the-problem-is-getting-worse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not feasibly recyclable</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recycling labels for plastic have come under scrutiny in recent years. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-09-29/us-store-drop-off-plastic-recycling-often-ends-up-in-landfills?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2023 article</a> by Bloomberg showed that General Mills’ Nature Valley Granola Bar wrappers are not being recycled through “store drop-off” but are instead being landfilled, incinerated or exported. An <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/abcnews.go.com/US/put-dozens-trackers-plastic-bags-recycling-trashed/story?id=99509422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC investigation</a> in May 2023 highlighted the failure of store drop-off systems to recycle plastic bags and films. Other large food companies such as Mondelez have recognized these risks and committed to <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/packaging-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce</a> plastic packaging and remove “store drop-off” and “check locally” recycling logos by <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/esg-topics/recyclability-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“General Mills’ emphasis on plastic recyclability over plastic reduction is misleading and ineffective,” said Annie Sanders, Green Century’s director of shareholder advocacy. “At the end of the day, General Mills needs to do right by its shareholders and the world around them. And the message from shareholders is clear: It’s time to reduce plastic pollution.”&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Boston &#8211; Mattel, Inc.*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to report on its single-use plastic in packaging to the standardized reporting framework CDP in [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					<p><strong>Boston &#8211; </strong>Mattel, Inc.*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to report on its single-use plastic in packaging to the standardized reporting framework CDP in 2025 after reaching an agreement with <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century</a>°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>Mattel uses plastic packaging for its popular toy brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, and continues to develop ways to improve the sustainability of its packaging.</p>
<p>“We have tremendous respect for the team at Mattel and applaud the company’s commitment to transparency,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Accurate data is critical for decision making, and this new commitment will let investors look ‘into the box’ to view how Mattel is reducing plastic waste.”</p>
<p>Mattel and Green Century had previously reached a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/">deal</a> in which Mattel agreed to set a company-wide plastic reduction goal. Mattel fulfilled that agreement in 2022 by committing to reduce its plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030.</p>
<p>This additional commitment to disclose information on single-use plastic in packaging to CDP will help stakeholders better understand Mattel’s sustainable packaging efforts through a recognized, standardized reporting platform.</p>
<h3><strong>Mattel to join 3,000 global companies reporting to CDP Plastic</strong></h3>
<p>Standardized reporting is an essential first step in reducing plastic pollution.</p>
<p>“Right now, each company discloses plastic information in different ways, making it nearly impossible for governments, recyclers, and investors to really know what plastic is out there,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We really view CDP as the gold standard when it comes to voluntary disclosure.”</p>
<h3><strong>Plastic pollution continues explosive growth</strong></h3>
<p>The current plastic waste system has failed to keep plastic out of the ecosystem. Only <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/campaigns/beyond-plastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastic waste is recycled</a>, while plastic pollution has doubled every six years.</p>
<p>Plastic waste makes its way into waterways, killing marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, as plastic doesn’t break down like other materials, small particles of “<a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/updates/microplastics-in-100-of-the-co-waterways-we-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics</a>” have been found in every environment and even the human bloodstream.</p>
<p>The issue has increasingly alarmed consumers and investors. Over <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of respondents to a recent survey have asked companies to use less single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Companies’ efforts to improve sustainability of their products and packaging are an important aspect of helping to protect the planet for future generations.</p>

					<p><b>(BOSTON) </b>Green Century° and Hilton Worldwide Holdings* reached a multi-year agreement for the major hotel chain to release an assessment of its single-use plastic by 2025 and set a plastic reduction goal by 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after competitors <a id="OWA8d5a00d0-04f6-7e87-8aae-8cc5e507a461" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/marriott-international-to-measure-cut-plastic-waste/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Marriott</a> and <a id="OWA7c7ba5ad-28f6-0034-d79a-25a6200cdd3c" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/choice-hotels-takes-first-step-in-tackling-plastic-pollution/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Choice Hotels</a> also agreed to measure and reduce single-use plastic, following agreements with Green Century.</p>
<p>“Neither Hilton nor its investors want to be stuck holding the bill for the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastic,” said <a id="OWA3a8141b8-fcc4-00d3-cbdf-c68eb0dca6d2" class="OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/" data-loopstyle="linkonly">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds. “We applaud Hilton for committing to reduce its contribution to the plastic pollution crisis.”</p>
<h3><b>Plastic Pollution Crisis Continues to Grow</b></h3>
<p>Plastic pollution has been doubling every <a id="LPlnk561662" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six years</a>. Plastics don’t degrade, but break into small pieces called microplastics, which impact oceans, soil, the atmosphere, and human health.</p>
<p>“Consumers learn more everyday about the serious issues with plastic,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Companies need a strategy for the future beyond single-use plastic.”</p>
<p>Hilton, like its competitors, provides single-use plastic in its rooms, guest common spaces, and food service locations.</p>
<p>While the environmental and health impacts of single-use plastic have long alarmed scientists, the scale of crisis is just starting to be better understood by consumers.</p>
<p>According to a recent study, <a id="LPlnk643534" title="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seventy-five percent of Americans</a> want to see the private-sector offer plastic free options, and 72% agree that companies should stop producing and using so much single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Recycling may not be the solution it once promised. Only <a id="LPlnk" title="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/whopping-91-percent-plastic-isnt-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastics</a> have been recycled, and many plastics aren&#8217;t recyclable at all, despite sporting the famous chasing arrows symbols.</p>
<p>Even plastics that are commonly recyclable, like #1 PET, <a id="LPlnk864054" title="https://pirg.org/articles/frequently-asked-questions-about-recycling-plastics/" href="https://pirg.org/articles/frequently-asked-questions-about-recycling-plastics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pose significant challenges</a>. Color, size, shape, chemical additives, and downcycling prevent many plastics from being turned into new products.</p>
