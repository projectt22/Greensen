										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This month has been dubbed <a href="https://www.plasticfreejuly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plastic Free July</a> and you may have read articles this year about people trying to live <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/26/nx-s1-5021546/plastic-free-sustainable-living-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/12/my-no-plastic-life-i-tried-to-cut-out-single-use-items-for-a-month-and-it-almost-broke-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic</a> for a week – and finding out that it’s all but impossible. Single-use plastics are everywhere. Why is that a problem and what can be done about it?<br></p>



<p><strong>1. What is the problem with plastic?</strong></p>



<p><br>Plastic pollution is everywhere, from the 36,000-foot-deep <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/plastic-bag-found-bottom-worlds-deepest-ocean-trench/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mariana Trench</a>&nbsp; to the peak of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount Everest</a>. And plastic is not just polluting places, it’s polluting the bodies of animals too, including humans. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/23/climate/seabirds-plastic-contamination-crunchy-australia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">778 pieces of plastic were found in the body of one seabird</a>.</p>



<p>Microplastics are now found throughout the human body and levels are especially concentrated in the brain. Adding to the concern, recent studies have found that <a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-microplastics-human-brains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accumulation of plastic in the brain</a> is growing in parallel with plastic waste in the environment, while according to the Pew Charitable Trust, if business as usual continues, plastic flows into oceans will <a href="https://www.pew.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triple by 2040</a>.</p>



<p><br><strong>2. What is the solution?</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Reduce!</strong> Step one: we need to use WAY less single-use plastic. We can do this by eliminating unnecessary plastic or substituting it for less harmful material like fiber.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reuse! </strong>Reusable packaging can either be made of plastic or other materials. In this case, instead of using the packaging once, it can be used, sanitized, and used again. Think Coca-Cola bottles. In many countries, including parts of Europe and South America, Coca-Cola sells its products in bottles that are used again and again, instead of using a bottle once and throwing it out. Refillable glass bottles can be <a href="https://upstreamsolutions.org/blog/nre-bottle-refill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reused about 50 times</a>!</p>



<p><br><strong>Recycle! </strong>Although most plastics are not widely recycled, recycling also plays a role in reducing plastic use. Companies are reducing their use of virgin plastic by using more recycled plastic.</p>



<p><br><strong>3. Can’t we just recycle our way out of this problem?</strong></p>



<p><br>No. While paper and metals are highly recyclable materials that can be recycled over and over again, it is harder to recycle plastic and as a result the recycling rate for plastic is only about <a href="https://stories.undp.org/why-arent-we-recycling-more-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9%</a>. Additionally, recycling plastic actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/recycled-plastic-more-toxic-no-fix-pollution-greenpeace-warns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increases health risks</a> by exposing local communities to toxic air emissions and increasing the toxicity of the plastic itself.</p>



<p><br><strong>4. So, what can you do?</strong></p>



<p>The good news is that there is a LOT we can do to reduce our use of plastic to protect the planet and our health. Here are some things individuals can do:</p>



<ul>
<li>Choose products that have less or no plastic packaging</li>



<li>Buy “used” rather than “new” when you can – whether it’s thrifting (yes, clothes contain plastic!) or toys for your kids, keeping new material out of the waste stream drives down demand for new plastic.</li>



<li>Tell the stores you shop at that you want to buy products without plastic packaging or that have reusable or refillable packaging.</li>



<li><a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/resources/how-young-environmentalists-can-help-tackle-the-plastic-pollution-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kids can protect the environment from plastic too</a>!</li>



<li>Urge your representatives to support effective legislation to cut plastic, including:<ul><li><a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/extended-producer-responsibility/epr-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extended producer responsibility</a> (EPR) laws, which make companies pay for the plastic waste they create;</li></ul><ul><li>Bottle bills, which pay customers to bring back bottles and have been shown to increase recycling rates;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Plastics bag bans, which have also been found to significantly <a href="https://grist.org/science/plastic-bag-ban-beach-cleanups-ocean-conservancy-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce the amount of plastic bags found in the environment</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><br>And if you’re a corporation that uses plastic, you can: reduce, reuse, recycle – in that order!</p>



<ul>
<li>First, make sure that you are only using essential plastic packaging.</li>



<li>Then, offer products in reusable packaging where appropriate.</li>



<li>Finally, for cases where you cannot eliminate or reuse the packaging, use packaging that is made from recycled plastic material.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><br>What is Green Century doing about plastics?</strong></p>



<p>As the manager of the Green Century Funds, Green Century Capital Management engages companies with large plastic footprints to press them to reduce their use of plastic. For example, Green Century convinced hotel chains Marriott, Hilton, and Choice Hotels to <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/why-are-big-brands-reducing-plastic/">reduce their use of single use plastics</a>. Because most plastic ends up in landfills and incinerators, we also engage with companies to make sure their recyclability claims don’t mislead consumers. For example, we got Starbucks to commit to ensure that its plastic <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/starbucks-to-expand-disclosure-on-reuse-assess-plastic-recyclability-labels/">recyclability labels</a> are accurate.</p>



<p><br><strong>Is this problem going to get solved?</strong></p>



<p><br>It is not all doom and gloom. A UNEP report found that we can <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/42277/Plastic_pollution.pdf?sequence=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce global plastic pollution by 80%</a> by 2040 – but collective action is key. 175 nations will meet in Geneva, Switzerland in August 2025 to negotiate a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02064-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global plastics treaty</a>. Our elected representatives in states across the country can and have passed laws that reduce plastic. Companies can act quickly on this, at the urging of investors, customers, and civil society organizations. We can turn this ship around, but we all need to get rowing in the same direction. Green Century will continue to push companies to cut plastic and build a truly circular economy on the one planet we’ve got.</p>

<p>Boston, May 2, 2025 &#8212; Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.* (KDP), the retailer of the leading single-serve coffee brewing system in the United States, has agreed to share more information about the recyclability of the plastic K-Cup pods used in its K-Cup brewing system. KDP made this commitment in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>



<p><br>“Investing in more sustainable packaging is a commitment that consumers and investors are increasingly looking for,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Given the reputational and legal risks associated with plastic packaging and misleading recycling labeling, Keurig Dr. Pepper should accelerate its transition to more sustainable options as soon as possible.”</p>



<p><br>KDP has agreed to provide consumers with information on whether their communities accept K-Cup pods for recycling. The company will also make it easier for readers of its sustainability report to understand what it classifies as recyclable. Finally, KDP has agreed to provide more information on the development of its K-Round system, which would make single-serve coffee in compostable, plant-based pods instead of plastic.</p>



<p><br><strong>What does it mean to be recyclable?</strong></p>



<p><br>According to the Federal Trade Commissions’ <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/federal_register_notices/guides-use-environmental-marketing-claims-green-guides/greenguidesfrn.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green Guides</a>, an item is recyclable if it can be “collected, separated, or otherwise recovered from the waste stream through an established recycling program for reuse or use in manufacturing or assembling another item.” In other words, a community must accept it for recycling collection and sufficient end markets must exist to turn the material into recycled plastic.</p>



<p><br>K-Cup pods are made from polypropylene, a material that <a href="https://recyclingpartnership.org/Polypropylene-Recycling-Coalition-Annual-Report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half of Americans can put in their curbside recycling bins</a>. However, far fewer communities accept these pods because they are hard to sort because they are so small. A <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/planet4-usa-stateless/2024/11/7287b658-gpus_finalreport_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Greenpeace report</a> found that only 1 out of the 375 material recovering facilities (MRF’s) included in the study accepted coffee pods made from polypropylene.</p>



<p><br>KDP has faced <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sec-keurig-dr-pepper-recyclability-settlement-coffee-k-pods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits</a> over its recyclability claims and was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fined by the SEC</a> for misleading shareholders about the recyclability of its K-Cup pods. California already regulates recyclability claims made by companies, and a <a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/wcs/recyclinglabels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new law</a> taking effect there in October 2026 that strengthens regulation of recyclability claims.</p>



<p><br>“We hope this move by KDP will make it easier for customers to access information on the recyclability of K-Cup pods in their communities,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century.</strong>. “We encourage the company to provide access to this information directly on its packaging.”</p>

<p>Boston, April 1, 2025 – Starbucks Corporation*, the world’s largest coffee chain, has agreed to disclose more details on its transition to reusable cups and ensure the accuracy of its recycling labels. These commitments came in response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, asking the company to address risks posed by its plastic waste.</p>



<p><br>“Single-use plastics cost the economy up to $120 billion <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/rethinking%20future%20of%20plastics/the%20new%20plastics%20economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">every year</a>, making plastic reduction a high priority issue for investors,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “We applaud Starbucks for strengthening its efforts to reduce plastic pollution by using more reusable cups and only labeling plastic as recyclable if it is widely recycled in practice.”</p>



<p><br>Starbucks agreed to share actions and plans to increase adoption of reusable cups by early 2026, building on the company’s existing efforts to bring ceramic mugs back to stores as the default option and accept reusable cups for drive-thru and mobile orders in the U.S. and Canada. Starbucks has also agreed to internally assess customer-facing recyclability claims against the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-issues-revised-green-guides/greenguides.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTC Green Guides</a> in 2025 and subsequently remove any misleading labels.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reusable Packaging Cuts Plastic Pollution</strong></p>



<p><br>Only 9% of plastic waste globally gets <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recycled</a>, while every year approximately <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/2023/11/how-single-use-plastics-hurt-our-oceans-and-warm-our-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33 billion pounds of plastic</a> enters the marine environment. Tiny pieces called microplastics have been found in human bodies and linked to cancer, respiratory disorders and neurological symptoms.</p>



<p><br>Reusable packaging is widely accepted as one of the most <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/rethinking%20future%20of%20plastics/the%20new%20plastics%20economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective ways</a> to avoid plastic waste, reduce costs, and respond to changing consumer preferences: in a recent survey, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72%</a> of respondents believe that companies should reduce their use of single-use plastic.</p>



<p><br>“Starbucks’ efforts to scale up reusable cups and ensure that its recycling labeling is accurate are important steps in the right direction,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/">Frances Fairhead-Stanova</a>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We need more companies to follow Starbucks’ lead and cut plastic waste by investing in reuse systems.”</p>



<p><br>According to the FTC Green Guides, a product or package should only be marketed as recyclable if the necessary infrastructure exists to recycle it. Most plastics do not meet this standard, making plastic reduction and reuse systems key to alleviating the plastic pollution crisis.</p>

<p><br>Coca-Cola sells beverages in more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherfarmbrough/2019/03/15/coca-cola-reveals-it-produces-3m-tonnes-of-plastic-packaging-a-year-in-ground-breaking-report/?sh=315b871e670f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 billion plastic bottles</a> a year and is the world’s <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2024/02/07/bffp-movement-unveils-2023-global-brand-audit-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest plastic polluter</a>. However, the company recently reneged on its goals to deliver 25% of beverages in reusable containers by 2030 and to cut 3 million metric tons of new plastic by 2025.</p>



<p><br>“Though Coca-Cola regrettably abandoned its plastic reduction and reuse goals, this new commitment to disclosing reusable packaging investments and results will help investors track the company’s efforts to mitigate plastic-related risks,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a>,<strong> president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “With plastic pollution <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/03/08/ocean-plastics-pollution-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doubling every six years</a> and less than <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/how-much-plastic-gets-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of it</a> getting recycled, it’s clear that reuse and reduction are key.”</p>



<p><br>According to experts, one of the most effective ways to <a href="https://emf.thirdlight.com/file/24/sjZ_pROsjk8VSKPsjXVEszMGHY/Unlocking%20a%20reuse%20revolution%20-%20scaling%20returnable%20packaging.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce both plastic use and plastic pollution</a> is by replacing single-use plastic containers with reusable ones. Reusable packaging is good for business, too. Studies show that <a href="https://www.greensportsalliance.org/playbooks/reuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumers want</a> companies to give them more reusable packaging options.</p>



<p><br><strong>Reuse Disclosure Necessary to Track Coca-Cola’s Efforts to Reduce Single-Use Plastic</strong></p>



<p><br>When Coca-Cola dropped its reuse goal in late 2024, the beverage giant stated that it plans to expand its use of reusable packaging in markets where existing infrastructure can support this important part of its portfolio. Coca-Cola reported that 14% of its beverages were sold in reusable containers <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/content/dam/company/us/en/reports/2023-environmental-update/2023-environmental-update.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in both 2022 and 2023</a>, but that the share of Coca-Cola beverages sold in reusable glass bottles <a href="https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1128/coca-cola-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased in 2024</a>.</p>



<p><br>“We will be monitoring Coca-Cola’s disclosure on how it is investing in reusables and how this translates into more beverages sold in reusable packaging,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a>, <strong>shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “At the end of the day, investors need these disclosures to ensure Coca-Cola is mitigating the regulatory, reputational and systemic risks posed by its role in the plastic pollution crisis.”</p>



<p><br>Plastic production is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/plastic-consumption-course-nearly-double-by-2050-research-2023-02-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on pace to double by 2050</a> without meaningful action to reduce it &#8211; and companies like Coca-Cola can make an outsized impact. Already, the equivalent of <a href="https://www.unep.org/plastic-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic</a> end up in our oceans, rivers and lakes every day. Studies show that microplastics are <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/02/how-microplastics-get-into-the-food-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polluting the human body</a>, too, and have been linked to serious health impacts.</p>

<p>As 2024 comes to a close, here are some of the year’s top highlights. Green Century° experienced some amazing events and impacts this year and we want to share some exciting examples of our nonprofit ownership, shareholder advocacy and environmentally responsible funds.</p>

Right whales are especially vulnerable to human activities because they travel near the ocean’s surface and along the coastline.</p>

<p>Recently I had the pleasure of moderating a fascinating panel that highlighted how Green Century° and other investors have helped promote conservation by <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Forest-Impact-Report-Indesign-file_converted.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Forest-Impact-Report-Indesign-file_converted.pdf">protecting forests </a>and other important wildlife habitats. This took place at the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) annual conference.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I was selected for this role is because of Green Century’s 10-year record of advocating for protecting key habitats, along with the people and wildlife that depend on these special places.</p>



<p>For example, Green Century has secured agreements to restrict or stop the razing and burning of forests with some of the world’s largest producers and traders, including <strong>Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)</strong>, * one of the world’s four biggest agricultural trading companies. But we need to do more – and helping mobilize global investors is a critical way we are going to do that.</p>

<p>The conference, which was held in Toronto, attracted nearly 2,000 investors who are interested in sustainable investing and provided a high-profile forum to showcase Green Century’s work in North America, <a>Asia</a> and South America.</p>



<p>UNPRI is a worldwide organization of thousands of investors who prioritize sustainable investing and use environmental, social, and governance data in their investment process. The Principles for Responsible Investment were developed by institutional investors and reflect the increasing relevance of environmental, <a>social</a> and corporate governance issues to investment practices through a process was convened by the&nbsp;UN’s Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>



<p>The panel displayed the past work of investors that have secured zero-deforestation agreements leading to greater transparency and conservation of endangered species’ ecosystems and habitats. &nbsp;The conference also kicked off a UNPRI initiative pressing companies to stop interfering with the passage and enforcement of nature and biodiversity regulations and rules.&nbsp;The session also provided an update of Spring, UN PRI’s collaborative stewardship initiative for nature, which focuses on the responsible conduct of influential companies when they engage with policymakers on biodiversity regulations and policies. Green Century’s Director of Shareholder Advocacy, Annie Sanders, sits on the Advisory Group for SPRING.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>While investors have made considerable progress in securing agreements with companies to stop deforestation, progress has too often been thwarted by corporate influence over public policy. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>This was demonstrated last week when EU President Ursula von Der Leyen gave into pressure from a handful of deforesters and proposed postponing the EU Deforestation Regulation for a year. The EUDR, which bans imports of products connected to deforestation, is the most important international forest policy of the last decade.</p>



<p>The delay is occurring while many of the companies who lobbied against the regulations are responsible for clearing large tracts by setting fire to South America’s forests, and new threats are emerging to Asia’s progress. Mighty Earth, one of the leading non-profit organizations, compared this regulatory delay to “throwing a fire extinguisher out of a burning building.”</p>

<p>While there, Annie Sanders and I strategized with our European investor allies on new ways to protect tropical rainforests and savannas as agribusinesses expand their production of palm oil, soy, timber, cattle and rubber and threaten these vital places. &nbsp;&nbsp;We had the chance to connect in person for the first time with many allies and recruit other investors to join us in this work.</p>



<p>The conference was inspiring and re-energized me to see more investors recognizing the importance of managing these risks and learning how to engage with the companies on these issues.</p>



<p id="block-7c47aa98-2c4e-4f6c-b886-4b6765b417dd">For example, North America’s Boreal Forest and the Amazon, and the species that depend on them &#8211; orangutans, jaguars, giant <a>otters</a> and even pink dolphins – are threatened by agribusiness.﻿</p>



<p>As environmentally responsible investors, we all see the crying need to push for more and help mobilize global investors to join forces to make real world progress and impact.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">Giovanna Eichner found the prospect of effecting change at companies as a worthy and compelling endeavor, so she jumped at a chance to join Green Century° in August as a shareholder advocate.<br><br>Green Century’s award-winning shareholder advocacy team of four people uses the Green Century’s stake as a shareholder to convince companies to change practices for the health of our planet. The team has won victories in a broad swath of issues and industries, including commitments to cut plastics use, protect forests, and reduce carbon footprints.<br><br>The David vs. Goliath dynamic reminded Giovanna of her environmental advocacy efforts at Boston College, where her student government helped convince the college to improve its environmental practices. Their efforts ranged from increasing funding for composting to cutting food waste.<br>“At Green Century, I saw a similar dynamic at play with advocacy and bigger institutions. I was really excited about pursuing climate policies in a way that was advantageous to both,” she said. “I think shareholder advocacy combines both of those elements and really values it.”<br><br><img decoding="async" width="301" height="226" class="wp-image-23532" style="width: 301px;" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg 2420w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1536x1153.jpeg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-2048x1537.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><br><br>Giovanna said she works on climate issues across a dozen industries, ranging from footwear and apparel to insurance and fast-food restaurants. The companies she negotiates with are mostly big-name brands and are in industries that are high carbon emitters. She said Green Century’s strategy also resonated with her.<br><br>“Green Century’s approach is one where you’re looking to make the case to a big institution in a way that benefits them. You must understand and empathize with the other side and convince them that our values are aligned. That is how you get them to buy in!”<br><br>A Somerville resident, Giovanna looks forward to a chance to connect with people who work at Green Century’s nonprofit owners and partners that own the mutual fund firm on campaigns that overlap, and that helps amplify the impact of Funds investors.<br><br>“The nonprofit ownership really stood out to me,” she said. “It shows how Green Century aligns investments with its values by taking all its net profits back to ownership. I also see how collaboration extends beyond financing – there is potential for teamwork on <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">Right to Repair</a>, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">plastics</a> and other issues.

<p><strong>BOSTON, September 24, 2024 – </strong>A noteworthy 40% of General Mills shareholders voted Tuesday in favor of a Green Century° proposal urging the food company to assess how it can increase the scale, pace and rigor of its sustainability efforts, including reducing plastic packaging. The proposal also urged General Mills to ensure its recycling labels don’t mislead consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Plastic pollution is harming our oceans, our wildlife, and our health,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century</strong> <strong>Funds</strong>. “General Mills’ investors have sent a strong message that the company cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution problem.” </p>



<p>The ocean ingests enough plastic every minute to fill a garbage truck, and global plastic consumption is on track to double by <a href="https://environmentenergyleader.com/stories/ocean-floor-polluted-with-11-million-tons-of-plastic-new-research-finds,1328#:~:text=Ocean%20Floor%20Polluted%20with%2011%20Million%20Tons%20of%20Plastic%2C%20New%20Research%20Finds,-Photo%20by%20Naja&amp;text=Recent%20research%20spearheaded%20by%20Australia&#039;s,reside%20on%20the%20ocean%20floor." target="_blank" rel="noopener">2040</a>. Though industry often elevates recycling as the solution to global plastic pollution, experts say reducing plastic use is <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/turning-off-tap-end-plastic-pollution-create-circular-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">key</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Green Century filed a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/general-mills-shareholders-call-for-less-plastic-packaging-over-55-of-voting-shareholders-opt-for-green-century-proposal/">similar proposal</a> two years ago asking General Mills to assess how it could cut its plastic use. That resolution received 56% of shareholder votes cast – one of the few majority votes on environmental issues in the 2022-2023 U.S. proxy season. Although General Mills has since enhanced some plastics-related disclosures, it neither issued the requested report nor disclosed substantive approaches, targets or plans to reduce its plastic <a href="https://globalresponsibility.generalmills.com/HTML1/general_mills-global_responsibility_2024_0054.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packaging</a>. Instead, the company doubled down on its goal to design 100% of packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030 &#8212; even though most plastic is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/24/1131131088/recycling-plastic-is-practically-impossible-and-the-problem-is-getting-worse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not feasibly recyclable</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recycling labels for plastic have come under scrutiny in recent years. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-09-29/us-store-drop-off-plastic-recycling-often-ends-up-in-landfills?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2023 article</a> by Bloomberg showed that General Mills’ Nature Valley Granola Bar wrappers are not being recycled through “store drop-off” but are instead being landfilled, incinerated or exported. An <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/abcnews.go.com/US/put-dozens-trackers-plastic-bags-recycling-trashed/story?id=99509422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC investigation</a> in May 2023 highlighted the failure of store drop-off systems to recycle plastic bags and films. Other large food companies such as Mondelez have recognized these risks and committed to <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/packaging-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce</a> plastic packaging and remove “store drop-off” and “check locally” recycling logos by <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/esg-topics/recyclability-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“General Mills’ emphasis on plastic recyclability over plastic reduction is misleading and ineffective,” said Annie Sanders, Green Century’s director of shareholder advocacy. “At the end of the day, General Mills needs to do right by its shareholders and the world around them. And the message from shareholders is clear: It’s time to reduce plastic pollution.”&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our shareholder advocates have won successes in cutting plastics, carbon footprints and more from companies. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2024, Green Century held companies accountable and helped make change by convincing companies to share plastics use, disclose both direct and indirect carbon emissions and other environmental advances in the shareholder advocacy season. Here is a look at some of the <strong>Top 10 Highlights</strong> of our big year:</p>



<p><strong>1.&nbsp;<u><strong>Big</strong> Box Plastics:</u></strong> <strong>Costco*,</strong> the world’s third-largest retailer, agreed to make visible its plastic footprint for its signature Kirkland Brand products and unveiled a five-year action plan to reduce plastic packaging by year’s end.</p>

<p><strong><u>2.</u></strong><strong><u>Reducing Plastic Use: </u></strong>After our shareholder engagements, global entertainment giant <strong>Disney*</strong> and toymakers <strong>Hasbro* </strong>and <strong>Mattel*</strong>, hotels <strong>Marriott*</strong>, <strong>Hilton*</strong>, and <strong>Choice Hotels*</strong>, and other companies agreed to disclose their plastic footprints and/or set goals to cut plastic use.</p>

<p><strong>3. Protecting Nature:</strong> Green Century’s team filed a resolution at <strong>PepsiCo* </strong>urging the snack and beverage behemoth to address protecting nature and habitats. This was the first time shareholders of a publicly traded company voted on a proposal requesting a comprehensive biodiversity report.</p>

<p><strong><u>4. Safeguarding an Environmental Treasure</u></strong>: Green Century continued its multi-year effort to protect the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia from the threat of a proposed mine for titanium, a widely used pigment in paint, sunscreens and other products. The 438,000-acre refuge is a vital habitat for threatened and endangered species. Our shareholder resolutions at The <strong>Chemours Company*</strong>, <strong>Sherwin-Williams* </strong>and <strong>Home Depot* </strong>helped raise awareness and galvanize environmental leaders to protect this special place.</p>

<p><strong><u>5. Protecting Clean Air</u>: Lowe’s*</strong>, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, will share details on the planet-warming emissions from the products it sells in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century. This kind of disclosure is a key first step in cutting pollution from items such as lawncare equipment, which are often among the biggest polluters for retailers.</p>

<p><strong><u>6. Curbing Emissions:</u></strong> While <strong>IBM*</strong> has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce all of its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won a whopping 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</p>

<p><strong><u>7. Right to Repair</u></strong>: In a big win for the environment, Green Century worked with <strong>Microsoft Corp.* </strong>to extend the lifespan of its computers. In response to a proposal from Green Century, Microsoft announced it would extend Windows 10 security updates for organizations of all sizes, including schools, hospitals, and individuals. This move could prevent up to 400 million computers from becoming electronic waste in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong><u>8. Preserving Tropical Forests</u>: </strong>Global agribusiness giant <strong>Bunge* </strong>sources soy from South American tropical ecosystems such as the biodiverse Amazon and neighboring Cerrado savanna where jaguars, giant otters and other rare animals live. These are the last places we should be clearing forests for food. After negotiations with Green Century, Bunge agreed to strengthen protections for these special places.</p>

<p><strong><u>9.

<p><strong><u>10. Insurance Wins: </u></strong>Green Century pushed <strong>Chubb*</strong> to phase out insurance for new fossil fuel supplies. The company, which is the largest publicly traded commercial property and casualty insurer in the world and a major insurer of oil drilling off the coast of Brazil, announced in 2023 it would no longer write policies for new extraction or pipelines in conservation areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, which received a 28% vote, asked Chubb to measure and disclose emissions associated with its underwriting, insurance, and investment-related activities. Secondly, Green Century filed a resolution, which received 38 percent of the vote, met with insurer <strong>Markel*</strong> to measure and disclose emissions associated with its underwriting, insurance, and investment-related activities.</p>

<div><b>Spotlight on disclosure</b></div>
<div>Have you ever tried to cut something in the dark? It is clearly not the best idea, and at worst it can be dangerous. The same is true for cutting plastic use. Without clear information on how much and what kind of plastic companies are producing, we are all in the dark.</div>
