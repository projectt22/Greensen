										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">

<p><strong>Boston, February 20, 2025</strong> – Bloomin&#8217; Brands, parent company of several of the largest U.S. restaurant chains, has agreed to strengthen its commitment to protect forests when sourcing ingredients for its 1,480 restaurants around the world. The move came after Green Century Capital Management filed a shareholder proposal asking the company to assess its impact on biodiversity and nature loss.</p>



<p>“We congratulate Bloomin&#8217; Brands on strengthening its forest protection policies,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “When you go out for dinner, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry that people are cutting down forests in the Amazon so you can eat your meal.”</p>



<p>Bloomin&#8217; Brands owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and several other casual dining chains. Through direct ownership and franchises it is responsible for <a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/d653a2f0-ac33-4137-80f8-93636fba2f03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,150 restaurants in the United States</a> and smaller numbers in other countries.</p>



<p><strong>Beef and Palm Oil Drive Tropical Deforestation</strong></p>



<p>Beef and palm oil production are among the largest reasons for the loss of rainforests worldwide. In exchange for Green Century withdrawing its shareholder proposal, Bloomin&#8217; Brands agreed to strengthen its policies to protect forests when sourcing these ingredients. For the first time, the company will disclose the percentage of beef sourced from Brazil. In addition, Bloomin’ says it will ensure that 60% of that Brazilian beef will come from verified deforestation-free sources. The company says it aims to increase this commitment to 100% in the future.</p>



<p>Bloomin’ will also improve the traceability of its palm oil products and agreed to include biodiversity impacts in the double-materiality assessment it is undertaking in 2025.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bloomin&#8217; Brands has a significant presence in Brazil, raising the possibility that beef sold in the company’s restaurants contributes to forest loss in the Amazon,&#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. &#8220;We appreciate the company&#8217;s willingness to begin tracking and disclosing its beef sourcing specific to Brazil. We hope this will pave the way for a commitment to 100% deforestation-free beef in the near future.&#8221; Green Century has been pressing Bloomin’ Brands to improve its forest protection policies for several years. In 2023, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/notable-43-of-bloomin-brands-shareholders-support-green-century-proposal-to-address-climate-change-and-deforestation/">43% of the company’s shareholders</a> voted in favor of a shareholder proposal by Green Century to address climate change and improve forest protection.</p>

<p>In the face of new attacks on our national environmental laws to protect the air, water and land we cherish, we sometimes feel powerless.</p>



<p>But I know that the best way to handle this challenge is to take all the individual and collective actions that we can. That’s why we will be showcasing ways for you to protect people and the planet in the months to come. With our non-proﬁt owners, we will be offering virtual and hands-on ways to protect pollinators, reduce plastic waste and conserve tropical rainforests.</p>



<p>Where you invest your future savings can make an impact. You can begin right now by starting or adding to your <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Green Century Funds</a> investment. You <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/ira-information/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024-SA-Season-Highlights-3.31.24-1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">can open or contribute to an IRA</a>, start an educational savings plan for a relative or read our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fossil Fuel Free Investing Guide</a> to get started. With every investment, you send a message that you won’t support companies that are contributing to wrecking the environment.</p>



<p>We can choose investments that avoid industries that literally fuel climate change and enrich oil, gas and insurance executives or we can put our money where it can beneﬁt the planet. We have choices and the combined power of our investments.</p>



<p>Will you join the thousands of Americans who are sending a message with their investments?</p>



<p>Green Century°, for more than three decades, has selected companies in its three mutual funds that have track records of acting responsibly for our environment. We are vigilant in ensuring these companies steward our planet, and our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/our-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">award-winning advocates </a>leverage the power as shareholders to hold companies accountable to their pledges.</p>



<p><em>A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>



<p>When we act with others, we can make a difference. Never has there been a moment of greater urgency. Let’s do this together.</p>

<p>Recently I had the pleasure of moderating a fascinating panel that highlighted how Green Century° and other investors have helped promote conservation by <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Forest-Impact-Report-Indesign-file_converted.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Forest-Impact-Report-Indesign-file_converted.pdf">protecting forests </a>and other important wildlife habitats. This took place at the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) annual conference.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I was selected for this role is because of Green Century’s 10-year record of advocating for protecting key habitats, along with the people and wildlife that depend on these special places.</p>



<p>For example, Green Century has secured agreements to restrict or stop the razing and burning of forests with some of the world’s largest producers and traders, including <strong>Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)</strong>, * one of the world’s four biggest agricultural trading companies. But we need to do more – and helping mobilize global investors is a critical way we are going to do that.</p>

<p>The conference, which was held in Toronto, attracted nearly 2,000 investors who are interested in sustainable investing and provided a high-profile forum to showcase Green Century’s work in North America, <a>Asia</a> and South America.</p>



<p>UNPRI is a worldwide organization of thousands of investors who prioritize sustainable investing and use environmental, social, and governance data in their investment process. The Principles for Responsible Investment were developed by institutional investors and reflect the increasing relevance of environmental, <a>social</a> and corporate governance issues to investment practices through a process was convened by the&nbsp;UN’s Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>



<p>The panel displayed the past work of investors that have secured zero-deforestation agreements leading to greater transparency and conservation of endangered species’ ecosystems and habitats. &nbsp;The conference also kicked off a UNPRI initiative pressing companies to stop interfering with the passage and enforcement of nature and biodiversity regulations and rules.&nbsp;The session also provided an update of Spring, UN PRI’s collaborative stewardship initiative for nature, which focuses on the responsible conduct of influential companies when they engage with policymakers on biodiversity regulations and policies. Green Century’s Director of Shareholder Advocacy, Annie Sanders, sits on the Advisory Group for SPRING.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>While investors have made considerable progress in securing agreements with companies to stop deforestation, progress has too often been thwarted by corporate influence over public policy. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>This was demonstrated last week when EU President Ursula von Der Leyen gave into pressure from a handful of deforesters and proposed postponing the EU Deforestation Regulation for a year. The EUDR, which bans imports of products connected to deforestation, is the most important international forest policy of the last decade.</p>



<p>The delay is occurring while many of the companies who lobbied against the regulations are responsible for clearing large tracts by setting fire to South America’s forests, and new threats are emerging to Asia’s progress. Mighty Earth, one of the leading non-profit organizations, compared this regulatory delay to “throwing a fire extinguisher out of a burning building.”</p>

<p>While there, Annie Sanders and I strategized with our European investor allies on new ways to protect tropical rainforests and savannas as agribusinesses expand their production of palm oil, soy, timber, cattle and rubber and threaten these vital places. &nbsp;&nbsp;We had the chance to connect in person for the first time with many allies and recruit other investors to join us in this work.</p>



<p>The conference was inspiring and re-energized me to see more investors recognizing the importance of managing these risks and learning how to engage with the companies on these issues.</p>



<p id="block-7c47aa98-2c4e-4f6c-b886-4b6765b417dd">For example, North America’s Boreal Forest and the Amazon, and the species that depend on them &#8211; orangutans, jaguars, giant <a>otters</a> and even pink dolphins – are threatened by agribusiness.﻿</p>



<p>As environmentally responsible investors, we all see the crying need to push for more and help mobilize global investors to join forces to make real world progress and impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green Century Funds° helps investors make an impact for the planet through a sustainable investing strategy, partners with its investment advisor in an award-winning shareholder advocacy program, and a unique ownership model that sends 100% of our net profits to support the environmental campaign work of our nonprofit owners.</p>
<p>One question we often get is, “How do you decide what issues to work on”?</p>
<p>This is an excellent question. There’s no shortage of issues facing our environment, and it can be hard to decide where to start making a difference. The good news is that while our planet may have more problems than it deserves, we’re finding more solutions every day to help fix them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17905" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="177" /></p>
<p>Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. Shareholder advocacy is a tool used by investors to push a company to report on or change a policy. Green Century negotiates with companies to improve their sustainability practices by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, protecting ocean wildlife from plastic pollution, adopting sustainable agriculture policies and more. Then, once companies make commitments, we assess their progress and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>To choose our priority issues, we evaluate a number of factors. First, we’re Green Century Funds for a reason – we’re all about protecting the environment. So, our first consideration is, how can we make the biggest impact for the planet? These issues run the gamut from stopping global warming, protecting endangered species, preserving forests or reducing plastic waste. We evaluate today’s most pressing issues which, if we can win concrete changes to corporate policy, will produce the most profound benefits for ecosystems around the world?</p>
<p>Then, we think about our comparative advantage. Where can we uniquely advance change? Where does our expertise lie? What emerging frameworks and targets can companies implement to mitigate environmental risks? On which issues can we make the strongest business case for action?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19274 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/raze-solar-pIcseKMisrs-unsplash-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p>At the end of the day, there’s no one issue that merits all of our attention; the threats facing our planet are multifaceted and ever evolving. But one thing we do know is that to ensure we have a planet to operate businesses on in the future, companies need to figure out now how to give back more than they take. And since nature is everybody&#8217;s business, there&#8217;s no company that can stand on the sidelines.</p>
<p>This coming shareholder season, which runs on a schedule similar to a school year, we’re focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting forests around the world by convincing food and consumer goods companies to protect biodiversity by addressing their nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, as well as by establishing science-based targets for nature that will protect our planet for generations to come.</li>
<li>Reducing plastic pollution by pressing companies to use less plastic in their packaging, especially new plastic, and to scale up reuse models that will help drive a circular economy.</li>
<li>Asking companies that have set goals to reduce their contribution to climate change to develop climate transition plans that chart how the company will hit their targets and move toward a clean energy economy.</li>
<li>Expanding the number of companies with Right to Repair policies that help consumers and reduce dangerous electronic waste.</li>
<li>Pressing insurance companies – which, ironically, are pulling coverage from areas prone to natural disasters exacerbated by extreme weather – to stop underwriting the new fossil fuel projects driving extreme weather in the first place.</li>
<li>Protecting animal welfare by asking companies to institute more humane policies such as eliminating gestation crates.</li>
<li>Pushing major retailers to phase out gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric lawn equipment to improve air quality and cut off another key contributor to climate change.<br />
A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just some of the solutions we’ll be advancing this coming year to help build a cleaner, greener future today and for future generations. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.</p>
<p>Thank you for your investment in Green Century Funds, which makes our shareholder advocacy work possible.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Director of Communications, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Boston, June 28, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kraft Heinz,* one of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> food and beverage companies in the world, announced a first-ever <a href="http://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/esg/pdf/GlobalDeforestationandConversionFreePolicy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Deforestation- and Conversion-Free Policy</a> in response to a Green Century Funds° shareholder proposal asking the company to eliminate deforestation across its supply chains by 2025. In exchange, Green Century withdrew its proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To achieve a climate-neutral world by mid-century, companies must drastically cut their contribution to deforestation, which accounts for 12% of global climate </span><a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We commend Kraft Heinz for acting to protect tropical forests, biodiversity and our climate.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Kraft Heinz’s new no-deforestation policy helps protect tropical forests</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kraft Heinz’s new stance on deforestation is an expansion of its 2018 </span><a href="https://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/pdf/Kraft_Heinz_Sustainable_Palm_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Palm Oil policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that established a commitment to sustainable palm oil. Notably, the new policy sets a 2025 deadline for eliminating deforestation from key commodities in Kraft Heinz’s global supply chains, aligning with recent </span><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/blog/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientific consensus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The policy covers commodities including beef and soy that are linked to deforestation in tropical regions such as the Brazilian Amazon, which is </span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/what-animals-live-in-the-amazon-and-8-other-amazon-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home to ten percent of all known species</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and among the last refuges for endangered species from jaguars and pink river dolphins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agriculture industry is the world’s largest contributor to deforestation, causing 75 percent of the world’s tropical deforestation, and the beef industry alone is responsible for </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some studies show it will be nearly impossible to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees without ending deforestation in </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/climate-math-what-a-1-point-5-degree-pathway-would-take#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beef, soy, palm oil and wood products drive the majority </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-drivers-deforestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of global deforestation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many of which are key ingredients in the Kraft Heinz products’ we know and love – from Oscar Meyer meats to Kraft Mac n’ Cheese,” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century&#8217;s Director of Shareholder Advocacy. “We applaud the company’s commitment to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains, thereby helping to protect forests and biodiversity around the world.”</span></p>
