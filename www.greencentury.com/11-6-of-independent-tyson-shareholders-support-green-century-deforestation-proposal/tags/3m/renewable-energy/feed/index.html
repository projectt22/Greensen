<p><strong>Green Century supports renewable energy sources, despite nuclear power’s resurgence.</strong></p>



<p>As data centers, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence, and other energy-guzzlers increase demand for power, nuclear energy is being pitched as a solution.<br><br>Data centers already make up roughly 2.5 percent of total U.S. electricity use today, according to <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/center/articles/a-surge-in-energy-intensive-computing-threatens-americas-renewable-energy-transition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis from Boston Consulting Group</a> — but exploding demand for artificial intelligence could drive that to 7.5 percent by 2030.<br><br>Green Century° remains unabashedly opposed to nuclear power and is unconvinced by arguments that today’s new small modular reactors are safe for people or the environment. Our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/the-green-century-funds/">three mutual funds purposefully exclude fossil fuels</a> because of the associated health and ecological impacts.</p>

<p>Nuclear energy is not clean or safe. Many of us remember the immediate environmental and public health fallouts from the Chernobyl, Fukushima and Three Mile Island disasters. At Chernobyl, a<a href="https://www.cnsc-ccsn.gc.ca/eng/resources/health/health-effects-chernobyl-accident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bout 600 workers at the power plant during the emergency received very high doses of radiation</a> and suffered from <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/radiation-sickness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radiation sickness</a>. Those who were exposed to the higher amounts of radiation became sick right away and subsequently died.<br><br>The hundreds of thousands of people who worked as part of the cleanup crews in the years after the accident faced increased risk of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/leukemia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leukemia</a>. Of the approximately 5 million residents of the contaminated areas surrounding, children and adolescents exposed from the Chernobyl accident showed an increased risk of developing <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/thyroid-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thyroid cancer</a>. These “new” small modular reactors. <a href="https://blog.ucs.org/edwin-lyman/five-things-the-nuclear-bros-dont-want-you-to-know-about-small-modular-reactors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the Union of Concerned Scientists</a>, still have potential for failures and are susceptible to the more frequent and intense storms caused by climate change.</p>

<p>Today’s consumers already have safe, clean reliable sources of renewable energy. We don’t need to resort to nuclear power. It’s dangerous and costs more than wind and solar. That’s why Green Century is steadfast in its commitment to avoid investing in nuclear power plants. We believe that any firm representing itself as sustainable or responsible should do the same.<br><br>To learn more about avoiding dirty fossil fuels and dangerous nuclear power plants, get our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Climate-Impact-Report-Indesign.pdf">Clean Energy Issue Impact report</a> and our <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide-sign-up/">fossil fuel free guide.</a></p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 7, 2025</strong> – 16.3% of Wolverine Worldwide, Inc.* investors cast their votes Thursday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to establish science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. Wolverine is the owner of several leading footwear and apparel brands, including Merrell, Saucony and Chaco.</p>



<p>“Ambitious climate targets lead to ambitious climate action,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Investors want Wolverine to not only disclose its climate emissions but also to set targets to reduce them on pace with the rest of the industry and in line with effective climate risk mitigation.”</p>



<p>Wolverine trails peers in disclosing its climate emissions and adopting science-based emissions reduction targets. While the goal of its brands is to bring consumers into the outdoors, Wolverine is not adequately protecting the natural places its customers value.</p>



<p><strong>The footwear and apparel industry is a major climate polluter</strong></p>



<p><a></a>According to some estimates, the footwear and apparel industry worldwide is responsible for more emissions than <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/fashion-on-climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined</a>. Therefore, Wolverine’s lack of emissions reduction targets may worry consumers &#8212; especially younger, increasingly climate-conscious customers &#8212; who understand the harmful impacts of growing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M</a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ore than</a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 10,000 companies</a>, 627 of which are in the footwear and apparel industry, have set or committed to setting science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. By adopting climate goals, these companies may better demonstrate that they are trying to decrease the threat climate change poses to their businesses and the planet.</p>



<p>“Wolverine should join its peers in more meaningfully tackling climate risk,” <strong>said Green Century shareholder advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Setting science-based targets would help Wolverine mitigate the financial, reputational, and systemic risks posed by climate change and ultimately advance the company’s efforts to protect the planet its customers seek to enjoy.”&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					
<p><strong>Boston, May 2, 2025</strong> – A Green Century° shareholder proposal urging The Timken Company* to adopt science-based targets to reduce its climate emissions received 8.91% of votes cast at the company’s annual meeting on Friday. The Ohio-based steel bearing manufacturer is a key supplier for the global automotive, rail, renewable energy and agricultural industries.</p>



<p>“Timken needs to meaningfully address its negative impact on climate change, not just trim emissions from a small portion of its business,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Addressing climate emissions from its supply chain will help Timken meet the expectations of its customers and investors to mitigate climate-related risks.”</p>



<p>Like many companies with global operations, Timken’s supply chain may be increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. <a href="https://impact.economist.com/projects/trade-in-transition/climate_change/" data-type="link" data-id="https://impact.economist.com/projects/trade-in-transition/climate_change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The frequency of billion-dollar weather events</a> has increased from once every four months to once every three weeks in just a decade. These floods, hurricanes, droughts and other severe weather disrupt the manufacturing and transport activities that companies, including Timken, depend on to maintain profitability.</p>



<p>Green Century secured an agreement with Timken in 2021 that led to the company adopting its targets to cut climate emissions from its direct operations by <a href="https://investors.timken.com/financial-news/press-release/2023/Timken-Releases-Annual-CSR-Report-Provides-Update-on-2030-Emissions-Intensity-Target-Progress/default.aspx#:~:text=Announced%20in%202022%20and%20measured,than%20it%20did%20in%202018." target="_blank" rel="noopener">50% by 2030</a>. Despite making significant progress toward that goal, Timken hasn’t updated those targets to encompass its full value chain, which <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represents the vast majority of its emissions</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Timken plays a critical role in the transition to renewable energy</strong></p>



<p>Timken is a major supplier for industries that are critical to reducing climate emissions. The solar and wind industries contributed more than 9% of its sales revenue in 2023, and its customers include companies such as BMW, Ford, and Mercedes, which <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have committed to major climate action</a>. As these customers seek to increase the sustainability of their supply chains, they will increasingly rely on suppliers reducing their own emissions.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Timken continues to be out of step with its peers and customers by failing to set science-based targets that would address its largest emissions sources, which may expose the company to not only the climate and transition risks of increasing emissions but also the competitive and reputational risks of remaining a laggard.</p>



<p>“Timken could bolster its image and position in the industry by committing to science-based climate targets across its full value chain,”<strong> said Green Century shareholder advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/">Giovanna Eichner</a>. </strong>“Passing up the opportunity to become a leader in the renewable energy transition may heighten risks for Timken’s business and investors.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have had a terrific 2023 and have made great strides in helping protect our planet and in making the world a better place through our robust shareholder advocacy, nonprofit ownership, and environmentally responsible funds. Here are some highlights.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Renewable energy plans for top chipmakers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-18785 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture1-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Silicon chips are found everywhere these days &#8212; in computers, cell phones, cars, and other consumer and industrial products. Green Century helped convince five top chipmakers to map out their paths to cut carbon emissions. This industry-wide win included some familiar names &#8212; Intel Corporation*, Texas Instruments*, as well as NVIDIA*, Advanced Micro Devices* and ON Semiconductor*. We’re pleased these companies agreed to specify the actions and milestones they will take to reduce carbon and source more renewable energy for the health of our planet.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> Convincing insurers to move away from fossil fuels</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-18786 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture2-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this year brought more frequent hurricanes, tornadoes, and intense storms due to climate change. Consequently, several insurance companies have stopped issuing new policies for homeowners in California and Florida because of mounting claims. We think it makes sense for them to stop offering insurance coverage to the very industry that has driven these problems. That’s why Green Century led the second year of our campaign to get insurers to stop underwriting and supporting new oil and gas projects. This year, Chubb*, one of the world’s largest insurance companies, agreed to announce it would immediately stop insuring oil and gas projects in conservation areas. This means that worldwide nature reserves, wilderness areas, and marine protected areas will be better safeguarded.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Deforestation rates hit decades-low in Indonesia</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Did you know that for decades tropical forests were destroyed for the cultivation of palm oil, which is found in products ranging from crackers, cookies, and cosmetics, and that Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil? Burning those forests eliminates habitats for orangutans, Sumatran Elephants and other wildlife while releasing tons of carbon pollution into the air.</p>
<p>So, it’s heartening that deforestation rates have declined steadily each year in Indonesia for the last 10 years. And in 2021, it hit a 22-year low!</p>
<p>For the last 10 years, Green Century has pressed companies to switch to producing, trading, buying, and changing how palm oil is grown in Indonesia to protect the environment and this year, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kraft-heinz-sets-global-policy-to-eliminate-deforestation-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">Green Century convinced Kraft Heinz*</a>, one of the largest food and beverage companies, to adopt the most comprehensive global forest protection policy we have ever seen from a food company.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Met people eager to invest with their values throughout the country </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Green Century traveled to events in every region of the country from Los Angeles to New York City, and wherever we went, we found individuals and financial advisors eager to invest in environmentally responsible ways. From the <em>Land Rally</em> in Oregon to<em> ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) for Impact! </em>in Colorado, we look forward to building on the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/events/">connections and conversations</a> we experienced.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Addressing the plastic pollution crisis</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18787" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Picture3-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Given the global and growing crisis of plastic pollution, Green Century has redoubled its efforts to encourage companies to recycle, reuse and reduce use of plastics. This year, we engaged companies one-by-one and joined forces with major investors in the <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/plastics-treaty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UN Global Plastics Treaty</a>, an ambitious global effort to end the age of plastic by 2024 in a legally binding document.</p>
<p>Our latest win involves Costco Wholesale*, one of the largest retailers in the world. Our shareholder advocates convinced Costco to expand its plastics reduction efforts. The company committed to increased plastic footprint disclosures and creating a 5-year plastic action plan. This victory, along with the policies we have secured from 12 other companies including Keurig Dr Pepper*, will help keep plastic out of our oceans and protect wildlife</p>

<p>Native bees will be less likely to encounter deadly pesticides thanks to new state laws spearheaded by Environment Colorado and Environment California. Together with many allies, they also secured new protections for the Boundary Waters (Minnesota), Bristol Bay (Alaska), Chaco Canyon (New Mexico) and the Grand Canyon region (Arizona). In November, voters approved an Environment Texas-backed $1 billion bond <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/articles/texans-vote-yes-on-1-billion-for-state-parks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to fund the largest expansion of parks in the state history</a>.</p>

<p>Green Century and nonprofit owner, Colorado Public Interest Research Group (CoPIRG) worked together on an effort that led to the Centennial State becoming the first in the nation ensuring farmers can fix their tractors and other equipment.</p>
<p>This victory builds on our earlier engagements with Deere &amp; Company*, the manufacturer of the iconic John Deere tractor and a wide array of other agriculture equipment, to reverse its opposition to the right-to-repair movement. Additionally, Green Century and CoPIRG together called on Google* to extend<a href="https://pirg.org/colorado/articles/when-will-my-chromebook-expire-why-computers-should-be-designed-to-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> software on Chromebooks used by school districts and students across the nation</a>. <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/googles-chromebook-extension-is-a-win-in-the-fight-against-e-waste/">Green Century engagement</a> led to the company announcing plans to continue software updates for Chromebooks for up to 10 years starting in 2024. This win means millions of serviceable laptops continued to be used instead of ending up in landfills.</p>

<li><strong>Led the Fossil Fuel Free Movement</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft wp-image-18796 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FFF-front-page-image-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Green Century became one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds in 2014 and this April we updated our popular <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide-sign-up/">Fossil Fuel Free Investing Guide,</a> co-authored this year with <a href="https://www.greenamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green America.</a>  Get your free copy and listen to our webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA_JM7-KayU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Greening Your Investments</em></a> if you or your family members are interested in joining thousands of individuals and institutions, including Harvard University and the Church of England, avoid the coal, oil and gas industry in your investments.</p>

<li><strong>Green Century’s president named to prestigious Barron’s List</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In April, I had the honor of being named to Barron’s <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-funds-president-named-to-prestigious-barrons-list/">100 Most Influential Women in U.S. Finance</a>, joining the ranks of prominent women including Treasury Secretary Janice Yellen and female leaders at the Federal Reserve, International Money Fund, Alphabet, and other places. As one of the very few women recognized in the socially and environmentally responsible investing field, I am heartened that our role in championing values-aligned investing and exposing greenwashing was recognized. We’re proud to help people understand the significant differences between investing strategies and shareholder engagement that sets Green Century apart from others.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> We appreciate investors – like you!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our top highlight is our supportive Green Century Funds investors. Our efforts to hold corporations accountable would not have happened without you.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, mmorgenstein@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</strong></p>
<p><strong>BOSTON, DATE, 2023 </strong>– After <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-applauds-emcors-commitment-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">engaging with Green Century</a>°, <a href="https://www.emcorgroup.com/divisions/emcor-building-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMCOR Group, Inc</a>. (EMCOR) has taken the next step in achieving its goal to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. It recently committed to establishing science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets with the highly regarded <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science Based Targets initiative</a>. EMCOR now has 2 years to set a near-term emissions reduction target aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold above which climate change impacts are likely to be severe.</p>
<p>EMCOR is a mechanical and electrical construction services company that conducts building energy audits and installs energy efficiency retrofits to HVAC and lighting systems. EMCOR also designs, builds and maintains alternative energy installations and has the expertise to support solar, wind, fuel-cell, biomass, landfill gas and tidal power generation systems. Such services are key to a society-wide transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p>“Even though achieving a near-term science-based target is ambitious, EMCOR deserves a lot of credit for accepting the challenge,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “As a society, the only way we’re going to cut greenhouse gas emissions to near zero is to create demand for clean energy and energy efficient technologies. EMCOR’s new commitment acknowledges this reality.”</p>
<p><strong>Transitioning to all-electric vehicles can help EMCOR cut emissions</strong></p>
<p>EMCOR travels to project sites across the country and uses its fleet of approximately 11,000 service vehicles, including pickup trucks, vans and heavy-duty transport vehicles, to deliver materials to &#8212; and support construction work at &#8212; customer sites. Prior to Green Century’s engagement, EMCOR had begun quantifying its greenhouse gas emissions and learned that the majority of its emissions came from its vast vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that EMCOR will have to procure low- and zero emission vehicles to meet its new commitment,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Fortunately, Ford, General Motors and Dodge have released or will soon release all-electric models of their iconic pickup trucks. Similarly, new all-electric vans, by Ford and by GM-owned Brightdrop, are just now hitting the market, so there’s a lot of opportunity for EMCOR to incorporate these new models into its fleet.”</p>
