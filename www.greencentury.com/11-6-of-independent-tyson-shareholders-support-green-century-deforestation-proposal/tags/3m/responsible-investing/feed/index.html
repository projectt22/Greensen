After close collaboration with Green Century, NXP pledged to develop a plan detailing its approach to achieving its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets, allowing Green Century to withdraw its proposal.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}">NXP is a Dutch company based in Eindhoven, Netherlands and has significant operations in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, and the broader Asia-Pacific region, including China. It both designs and manufactures analog and digital microchips and co-invented technology with Sony that allows consumers to use their <a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/blog/from-bricks-to-brains-mobile-phones-and-the-evolution-of-nfc:BL-MOBILE-PHONES-EVOLUTION-OF-NFC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile phones as electronic wallets</a>. NXP’s chips also allow commuters to use their phones or smart cards to purchase trips on major public transit systems, and  can be found in <a href="https://www.nxp.com/applications/smart-city/identification/electronic-passportepp:ELECTRONIC-PASSPORT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electronic passports</a> where they protect sensitive personal information.</span></p>

These plans describe how companies will evolve their business strategies, invest capital, measure progress, and assess anticipated obstacles in order to achieve their GHG emissions reduction targets. They can provide investors assurance that companies’ goals are not just aspirational but actually intended to be fulfilled.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">NXP has already established ambitious targets for reducing its carbon footprint. For example, it aims to reduce the emissions from its operations by 35% by 2027; in that same year, NXP plans to source 50% renewable energy to power its business. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Asset managers need transparency to adequately assess risks and create value for their investors.   NXP’s climate transition plan is a roadmap that will show how the company will navigate its way to shrinking its carbon footprint.  It will help provide insights into its climate risks, which is a factor that any investors should measure and manage,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

The Consortium urges its members to reduce their GHG emissions to help limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C.

Green Century would like all our portfolio companies to do the same, which is why our recent engagements have focused on ensuring corporate climate goals are backed up by strategy and action. Climate transition plans are an important way to do this – almost the equivalent of saying ‘show us your homework.’”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Green Century then filed a shareholder proposal asking Corning to address its climate risk by adopting emissions reduction targets.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Established in 1851 as Corning Glass, the company’s products are linked to American history. For example, Corning produced the very first electric light bulbs for Thomas Edison in the 1880s, and in 1915 sold its first line of glass products that could be used for baking and storage under the brand name, Pyrex. More recently, Corning has delivered millions of miles of fiber optic cables to support widespread broadband access. Corning also developed a durable glass, known as Gorilla Glass, for Apple’s first iPhones, a product that is currently used in more than 8 billion devices worldwide, including smart phones, tablets, and laptops.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2023, Green Century followed up with Corning and asked the company to develop and publish a climate transition plan.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In early 2023, the General Secretary of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, urged business leaders at the World Economic Forum, to “put forward credible and transparent transition plans on how to achieve net-zero – and submit those plans before the end of this year.&#8221;  More than 4,100 organizations have disclosed to CDP (a reporting platform formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) that they have prepared climate transition plans; however, CDP reports that only 45% were public, and only 12.6% covered what are considered key elements of a credible transition plan. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Now that more and more companies have committed to significantly cut their emissions, investors and stakeholders want assurance that goals and targets aren’t just greenwashing,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “We’re eager to see Corning develop a credible climate transition plan provides milestones, indicators for success, mechanisms for board and executive oversight, and enough details to instill investor confidence.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><strong>(Boston, October 11)</strong> The Green Century° Equity Fund has filed a shareholder resolution with Deere &amp; Company* asking the company to issue a public report assessing the potential damage to the brand’s reputation from opposing Right to Repair legislation.</p>
<p>Deere, the iconic tractor company, has received significant scrutiny for its opposition to “Right to Repair” laws, which allow farmers to access diagnostic software, parts and instructions to repair their own machinery. A class-action lawsuit filed against Deere by farmers alleges that the company violated antitrust laws by restricting repair to dealerships, which increased company profits while hurting farmers.</p>
<p>Shareholders Concerned That Deere Is Not Doing Enough to Support Right to Repair</p>
<p>Recent polls indicate that an overwhelming 84% of Americans support Right to Repair legislation. In April 2023, Colorado became the first state to enact Right to Repair laws specifically targeting farm equipment. To date, 30 additional states have introduced Right to Repair bills, highlighting the growing momentum behind the issue.</p>
<p>While Deere recently signed a “memorandum of understanding” (MOU) with The American Farm Bureau Federation which would allow farmers to buy access to repair information, the agreement has come under scrutiny. According to the MOU, the Farm Bureau would be restricted from advocating for enforceable legislation, and Deere would be allowed to pull out of the agreement if any legislation is passed.</p>
<h3>Deere Opposed Right to Repair on Flimsy Grounds</h3>
<p>There are also concerns that in its rush to oppose Right to Repair legislation, Deere may have made misleading statements in federal filings regarding the environmental consequences of repair.</p>
<p>Deere claimed that existing EPA regulations and the Clean Air Act were some of the reasons that it would not give independent repair shops access to its diagnostic tools. In August 2023, however, the EPA issued a statement that it had no policy on restricting owners’ repairs of emissions-related components of their products to properly function.</p>
<p>Green Century previously filed a shareholder proposal with Deere on the same issue in 2021. Shareholders were unable to vote on the measure as Deere petitioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to exclude the proposal from the ballot. At the time, Green Century° President Leslie Samuelrich said, “Deere seems to be more focused on stifling shareholder concerns than addressing them. Spending time and energy on an SEC challenge could be put to better use by making their products better serve their customers.”</p>

<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-482-0800</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 16, 2023</strong> –  <a href="https://www.bldr.com/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Builders FirstSource</a>, the country’s largest building product supplier to the professional market, released the vote result from its annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday. Green Century° received a notable 21% of the vote in favor of its shareholder proposal, which asks the company to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. The proposal additionally asks the company to set goals for sourcing more renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency in its operations, and procuring zero-emission vehicles.</p>
<p>To implement science-based targets, the company would have to reduce its direct, operational emissions and its indirect emissions including from timber harvested for the lumber it sells. Over <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5000 companies</a>, including competitors <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/stories/fresh-thinking/lowes-science-based-net-zero-target-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/sustainability/home-depot-reduced-carbon-emissions-more-127000-metric-tons-2020-commits-100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, have committed to working with the Science Based Targets initiative, and nearly <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fortune-500-companies-are-acting-on-the-climate-crisis-but-is-it-enough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of all Fortune 500 companies have set some kind of climate change reduction target.</p>
<p>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a> said:</p>
<p>“Last year, we filed a nearly identical proposal at Builders asking for reduction targets which received a resounding ‘yes&#8217; vote from investors &#8211; but Builders took almost no action. The company <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001316835/579d09c7-0f03-4884-baa0-f9a54cd7af4e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relies heavily on timber</a>, which comes from forests that are significantly threatened by climate change. We believe management needs to start taking this risk seriously by measuring, disclosing, and setting reduction targets for its Scope 3 supply chain emissions.”</p>
<h4>Green Century Engaged with Builders FirstSource to Set First Emissions Reduction Targets</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century added:</p>
<p>“At the 11th hour, Builders disclosed its <a href="https://s202.q4cdn.com/867695273/files/doc_downloads/esg/Builders-FirstSource_2023-CSR-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scope 1 and 2 emissions</a>, which cover the direct emissions from its operations, and stated it will set emissions reduction targets for both these categories in 2025. While we appreciate that Builders is now taking action on a part of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-at-builders-firstsource-annual-meeting-green-century-wins-majority-vote-on-climate-change-proposal/">Green Century’s 2022 proposal</a>, the company has not yet measured, disclosed, or set targets for its Scope 3, or supply chain emissions, leaving investors in the dark for what comprises, on average, 75% of companies’ climate <a href="https://www.wri.org/update/trends-show-companies-are-ready-scope-3-reporting-us-climate-disclosure-rule#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%20account%20for%2075%25%20of%20companies,greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20on%20average" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions</a>.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocacy, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, June 14, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> –The shareholders of the General Motors Company will vote Tuesday, June 20 on a Green Century</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shareholder proposal asking the company to improve the sustainability of its aluminum, steel, rubber, and leather supply chains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While GM has taken steps to increase the sustainability of its operations, it continues to face climate risk from the global sourcing of its automotive materials,” said Green Century Funds President, </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “GM has an opportunity to be an industry leader by investing in low-carbon aluminum and steel – as well as by protecting tropical forests from the destructive practices associated with producing leather and rubber.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production of aluminum and steel used for automotive parts and manufacturing equipment has a heavy carbon footprint. For example, the world’s auto manufacturers consumed 18% and 11% of global aluminum and steel production respectively, according to tallies completed in 2019. Globally, manufacturing steel and aluminum creates billions of tons of carbon dioxide pollution annually, or about 13% of total global GHG emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, the leather and rubber that GM sources for its car seats and tires, may be associated with deforestation and land clearance. In Brazil, a country considered a major source of leather for U.S. auto manufacturers, raising cattle causes nearly 70% of the country&#8217;s deforestation. The automobile industry is also the biggest consumer of natural rubber, and rubber tree cultivation is a leading driver of deforestation in Southeast Asia and West Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite GM’s recent commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, the company does not yet disclose the emissions associated with these key materials, nor does it offer concrete strategies for reducing those emissions. Additionally, GM has yet to set a zero-deforestation target – a commitment that would prevent land clearing for cattle pasture or rubber tree plantations.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><b>All in on EVs by 2035 Not Enough to Limit Climate Change</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a 2023 report published by Rivian and Polestar, auto manufacturers need to act quickly to reduce supply chain emissions in line with limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes that even with a transition to battery electric vehicles and using 100% fossil-free energy to power them, auto manufacturers should address supply chain emissions to reach this goal. Thus, GM’s commitment to 100% sales of EVs by 2035 may not be enough to sufficiently mitigate its climate impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GM has made remarkable strides to reduce its environmental footprint, but it needs to focus its attention on its supply chain issues,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “GM should act quickly and holistically since its footprint is expansive and there’s little time for delay if we&#8217;re to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.”</span></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 19, 2023</strong> – – Shareholders of Mondelēz International, Inc., a food company known for its popular snack brands, such as Chips Ahoy!, Cadbury, Ritz, and Oreo, were reluctant to support a Green Century° <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000130817923000589/lmdlz2023_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a>, as evidenced by the vote tally released on Friday. The proposal, which asks Mondelēz to disclose interim targets for achieving its goal to source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025, captured <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1103982/000110398223000025/mdlz-20230517.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9.8% of the total vote</a>.</p>
<p>Demand for cage-free eggs, and the supply to match it, has grown dramatically in the U.S. and European Union in recent years –driven by consumer awareness of and desire for humanely-raised animal proteins as well as government pressure on manufacturers to switch to producing cage-free eggs. The term “cage-free” was coined in response to farmers’ use of “battery cages,” where hens are housed in spaces that are smaller than the size of a piece of printer paper.</p>
<p>Mondelēz first announced in 2016 that it would source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025. However, recent company disclosures of current sourcing volumes indicate that it is unlikely to meet its goal, which prompted the Green Century proposal. In recent years, excluding its Russian and Ukrainian egg markets, Mondelēz sourced cage-free eggs at a rate of 27% in 2020, 39% in 2021, and 43% in 2022. Extrapolating from its current progress, Mondelēz would achieve a sourcing rate of only 59% by the end of 2025, far short of its original ambition.</p>
<p>However, Mondelēz peers, General Mills and Conagra, disclose their planned progressions toward their global cage-free egg targets and are further along in achieving their goals than Mondelēz. Further, Target and a wide range of quick service food retailers including Jack in the Box, Denny’s, Bloomin’ Brands (the parent of Olive Garden) have also disclosed similar cage-free egg glide paths to their shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> responded to the vote result by saying: </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>“While we had hoped for greater support for our proposal, this is the first year we’ve brought this issue of cage-free egg goals to Mondelēz shareholders for a vote. Without publishing a clear path for achieving its 2050 cage-free egg sourcing goal, Mondelēz may be inviting unnecessary risk by being seen as not living up to its obligations. This is especially true because we’re talking about a sensitive animal welfare issue that has quite a bit of public support.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Disclosure is central to investor decision making, but Mondelēz has told us that disclosing interim targets for its 100% cage-free egg by 2050 goal would be “burdensome, unnecessary…. and could generate confusion among our stakeholders.” Given that it’s now 2023 and Mondelēz committed to reach its goal in 2025, one has to ask, does it really have a plan? If so, why wouldn’t it share it with investors?  For the sake of its investors, customers, and the health of the animals in its supply chain, I hope it does and it will.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2023</strong> &#8211; Green Century° and the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, have filed a shareholder proposal with McDonald’s urging it to eliminate routine use of antibiotics that are important to protecting human health on the animals in its supply chains. The proposal goes to a vote on Thursday, May 25.</p>
<p>The Sisters had previously pressed McDonald’s to engage its pork and beef suppliers to phase out use of the types of antibiotics on their animals that people also use. In 2018, the Sisters filed a similar proposal and withdrew it in exchange for McDonald’s promise to announce reduction targets by 2020. McDonald’s failed to meet its promise.</p>
<p>Administering low doses of antibiotics in food and water can spur development of ‘superbugs’ in farm animals and create bacteria so resistant to treatment that even the most potent antibiotics can fail to stop the disease. There are a handful of transmission pathways for antibiotic-resistant bacteria that allow them to jump from farm animals to humans. Infection can happen through handling bacteria-laden meat from the supermarket, drinking water polluted by farm runoff, and direct contact with animals by farm workers and meat processors. In 2021, the United Nations announced that we may soon reach a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/11/1106472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘tipping point’</a> when antimicrobial resistance becomes the leading cause of death – surpassing heart disease.</p>
<p>McDonald’s new <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responsible use policy</a> encourages producers and veterinary professionals, among others, to “share responsibility for proactively developing and implementing effective best management strategies to reduce, and where possible eliminate, the need for [medically-important] antibiotic use.”</p>
<p>However, the policy falls short of the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment/">proposal’s request</a>. Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters had asked McDonald’s address use of antibiotics in its pork as well as beef supply chains. Further, the policy does not address the need for elimination targets, timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, or guidelines for enforcement when suppliers fail to meet McDonald’s guidelines.</p>
<p>“The upcoming vote is an opportunity for shareholders to assess the gap between what McDonald’s had stated it would do in the past to its new responsible use policy,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “In 2018, McDonald’s promised the nuns that it would announce targets by the end of 2020. It reneged and provided a responsible use policy that has no teeth. In my opinion, it appears to be more aspirational than actionable.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Director of Communications, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, April 17, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Colgate-Palmolive*, a leading global consumer products </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3456/colgate-palmolive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will enhance its efforts to reduce plastic packaging and scale up reuse models that cut down on single-use plastic. In exchange for this heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Capital Management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction of total plastic packaging use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/10/breakingtheplasticwave_mainreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 million tons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of plastic waste is released into the ocean annually, </span><a href="https://conserveturtles.org/information-sea-turtles-threats-marine-debris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killing more than 1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marine animals each year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Colgate-Palmolive for stepping up its efforts to tackle the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Colgate-Palmolive to accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colgate-Palmolive’s planned actions include more thorough disclosure in future sustainability reports of </span><a href="https://www.colgatepalmolive.com/en-us/who-we-are/stories/plastic-commitments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reuse pilots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company has launched or planned, such as refillable jars for toothpaste tablets and Palmolive dish gel sold in refillable bottles. The company also will publish a “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its upcoming 2023 sustainability report and accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction that will prioritize packaging redesign and expansion of reuse and refill models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s clear that we can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Colgate-Palmolive significantly reduce its total contribution to plastic waste as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #008000;">States will make producers responsible for the waste they create</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s focus on plastic reduction comes not a moment too soon: a December 2022 survey found that 84% of registered U.S. voters support increasing the use of reusable packaging and foodware, and 80% support requiring companies to reduce their single-use </span><a href="https://usa.oceana.org/press-releases/americans-are-sick-of-single-use-plastic-pollution-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic packaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Governments are also taking note: since 2021, Maine, Oregon, California and Colorado have adopted the nation’s first producer responsibility laws for consumer packaging, which will make producers financially responsible for the packaging waste they create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our environment for centuries,” added Sanders. “Reuse and refill models, which </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rank among the most effective ways to replace single-use plastics, are critical solutions that companies must urgently scale up to meet one of the most profound environmental challenges of our time.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">December 2022</span></h5>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Rebecca Sherratt</span></h5>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interview with Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, and Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, at Green Century Capital Management. Founded in 1991, Green Century is an investment advisory firm based in Massachusetts that manages environmentally responsible funds.  </span></i></p>
<h4><b>Green Century&#8217;s sustainability proposals target a broad range of issues, how do you identify companies to engage with on these topics? </b></h4>
<p><b><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-13901" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Annie-Sanders-Headshot-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Annie Sanders (AS): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To speak on plastic pollution and deforestation engagements, we contemplate a number of factors when working out who to engage with. One of our key considerations is identifying which companies are not only well-positioned to drive change but also lagging behind peers in their sustainability commitments. We also analyze a company’s supply chain to identify how companies in the chain could help move an issue or affect the decision-making of a larger entity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking broadly across all sectors is also important, and we try to engage with issuers in sectors where perhaps not a lot of activity has taken place on deforestation, right-to-repair reporting, or plastic pollution. We are often one of the first investors to engage with a particular company around a given issue, so we like to think of ourselves as ESG trailblazers, in that sense.</span></p>
<p><b><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14823" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ranger-Andrea-Square-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />Andrea Ranger (AR): </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of climate change, our remit as a mutual fund that excludes any companies involved in fossil fuels from developers to utilities is to look for ways to continue to phase out fossil fuels to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. We look for opportunities to really push the envelope out on climate commitments, like asking companies to commit to near-, medium-, and long-term science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Now, we are also making a foray into asking companies to disclose their climate transition action plans.</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4></h4>
<h4><b>Shareholder proposals faced criticism this year for being overly prescriptive and poorly targeted. What are your thoughts on this?  </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AR:</strong> This narrative is certainly an interesting one. This trend basically boils down to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issuing a legal bulletin last November, mandating that shareholder proposals can no longer be omitted if they relate to issues of broad social or ethical concern. Because of this bulletin, everyone pushed the envelope out. Investors were no longer filing proposals asking for watered-down reporting, which, in prior years, was the only way to get ESG proposals past the SEC. The new Biden era SEC administration has a much broader view of material risks and so investors took a more aggressive approach in their engagements to mirror the urgency needed to address climate change. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors asked companies to adopt more specific policies and report on specific goals, like science-based emissions targets, for example. The advent of the war in Ukraine also tipped the scales, so leading fund managers could say ESG proposals were not providing boards with enough flexibility. We see this whole pushback to ESG as the “BlackRocks” of the world walking back on their ESG commitments, especially on climate.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Century made the history books this year for receiving the highest level of support for any plastic-related shareholder proposal in history, with its request for Jack in the Box to report on its sustainable packaging endeavors winning 95.4% support, despite facing management opposition</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><b>In your experience, are companies more open to engaging with shareholders now than they have been in previous years?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AS:</strong> I think that certainly seems to be the trend. Companies are realizing that climate risk is also economic risk and so they need to start taking these concerns seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AR:</strong> ESG issues are becoming unavoidable and I think companies are now seeing it’s best to get on top of these issues rather than giving investors the stiff arm and ignoring us. I can think of several companies that, in previous years, have certainly just given investors the stiff arm but are now starting to engage with and recognize these issues.</span></p>
<h4><b>Texas comptroller Glen Hegar recently placed Green Century on a list of financial institutions deemed to be &#8220;boycotting&#8221; energy firms. Do you think the growing anti-ESG movement could pose an issue for responsible investors?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AR:</strong> The way we view ESG at Green Century is that it is a continuum of the broad spectrum of risks investors look at when deciding whether to invest in a company, so it is unfortunate ESG has been categorized as a separate set of risks from financial risks. They’re just risks. As a fiduciary, we have to look at the financial value and performance of a stock but also need to look at those ESG risks which are just as pertinent to financial performance. In terms of what we do, the anti-ESG kerfuffle is not affecting us. Investors come to us because of the values we hold, they are not going to divest from us because of “woke” capitalism. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think a lot of the sound and fury coming from anti-ESG groups like the Texas Comptroller have given some of the larger asset managers pause. BlackRock is in this weird position, saying on the one hand that yes, it is committed to ESG but, on other hand, proclaiming it has invested millions of dollars into Texas oil and gas. BlackRock is very much between a rock and a hard place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AS:</strong> Although the ESG backlash is very vocal, it does also form a relatively small minority of investors and other entities. I think ESG and sustainable investing will only continue to grow, despite the barrage of criticism and accusations.</span></p>
<h4><b>What key topics will Green Century be focusing on in the coming proxy season?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AR:</strong> Currently, we are engaging with a fast-food chain and a food producer on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Unlike in Europe, where antibiotic use in all forms is more restricted, here in the U.S. we are starting at a much lower tier of getting routine use of medically important antibiotics out of the food chain. We will also be calling on companies to commit to science-based emissions targets through the Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi), looking for climate action transition plans, and again looking at the fossil fuel underwriting of leading U.S. insurance companies. We have meetings coming up with many issuers on these topics so we will see what happens. Some engagements may escalate to proposal filings.</span></p>
<h4><b>We are often one of the first investors to engage with a particular company around a given issue, so we like to think of ourselves as ESG trailblazers. </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AS:</strong> We’ll also be continuing our work to urge companies that source forest-risk commodities to mitigate climate and nature-related risk by eliminating deforestation and native vegetation conversion from their supply chains. Finally, we’ll continue our focus on plastic pollution by asking companies to reduce their plastic packaging footprint in order to mitigate the flow of 11 million tons of plastic waste released into the ocean every year.</span></p>
<h4><b>If you could introduce one corporate governance reform, either in the U.S. or internationally, what would it be?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>AR:</strong> Both issuers and investors would benefit from having someone on the board who is actually fluent in sustainability issues. A director well-versed in climate change would be very valuable, but even someone who has some understanding of broader sustainability issues like deforestation or plastic pollution would be welcomed. Looking at the qualifications of U.S. corporate board members, there is very little ESG </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">experience among directors. And even when you find a director with what might still be only a limited amount of ESG experience, these directors sit on each others’ boards, bringing little new perspective to the table.</span></p>
