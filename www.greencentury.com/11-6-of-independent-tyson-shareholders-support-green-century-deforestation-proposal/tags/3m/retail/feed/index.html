<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 – </strong>13.9% of shareholder votes Wednesday were cast in favor of a resolution asking Amazon to report the climate emissions from all of its retail sales. Green Century,° along with shareholder representative <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a><em>,</em> filed the resolution with the retail giant on behalf of shareholders.</p>



<p>“Amazon is failing to provide transparent and complete data on its emissions,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Without a clear picture of Amazon’s emissions, investors cannot analyze the company’s climate impact and associated risks.”</p>



<p>Amazon does not report emissions <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associated with 99% of the company’s retail sales</a><strong><em>.</em></strong> Unlike its peers <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/esgreport/our-esg-priorities/2023%20CDP%20Climate%20Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mobilecontent.costco.com/staging/resource/img/25w03130/5a_ClimateActionPlan_FY24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco</a>* and <a href="https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/c70c48ab-0e10-4576-9e92-789e30665964/2023-CDP-Climate-Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target</a>*, the company only publishes the emissions of its Amazon-branded products, which make up a mere 1% of retail <a href="https://www.momentumcommerce.com/amazons-private-label-market-share-shrinks-by-6-year-over-year-in-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a>.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s emissions disclosures do not align with the global standard for corporate greenhouse gas reporting, which its major peers are following,” <strong>said Parker Caswell, climate and energy senior associate at <em>As You Sow</em>. </strong>&#8220;Amazon must live up to investor expectations and report more than the emissions from products that make up just <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of its sales</a>.”</p>



<p>Despite investor concern, and coming regulations in <a href="https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/sustainability-reporting-and-auditing-scope-3-supplier-emissions#DoScope3EmissionsNeedToBeReported" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the European Union</a> (EU) and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California</a> that may mandate more detailed disclosures, Amazon has not indicated it will improve its reporting.</p>



<p><strong>Amazon fails to measure up to climate commitments</strong></p>



<p>The retail sector is responsible for <a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-retailer-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% of global greenhouse gas emissions,</a> which means large retailers can play a crucial role in tackling the climate crisis. Amazon recognized this in declaring its <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/planet/climate-pledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious target to cut emissions</a> by 2040, citing the need for meaningful action to halt climate change.</p>



<p>While Amazon has set targets to tackle climate change, it has also faced <a href="https://medium.com/enrique-dans/why-amazons-own-employees-are-calling-it-out-for-greenwashing-ff7ace354cb7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaints from its employees</a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250314136610/en/Hagens-Berman-Amazon-Faces-Consumer-Lawsuit-Alleging-Deforestation-Behind-Amazon-Basics-Paper-Products-and-Greenwashing-Cover-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal challenges from customers</a> on the accuracy of its climate disclosures and marketing.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s climate mitigation efforts should match the scale of its business, “<strong> said</strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong> </strong></a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“It’s time for Amazon to live up to its own climate ambition and investor expectations for mitigating climate-related risks.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 15, 2025</strong> – On May 21, Amazon shareholders will vote on a proposal asking Amazon to disclose the total climate emissions associated with its retail sales. This is the second year Green Century<em>°</em> and shareholder representative <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a> are requesting that Amazon more comprehensively measure the greenhouse gas footprint of the products that contribute to its retail sales.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s status as a dominant global retailer means its products have a massive climate impact,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Failing to report full product emissions is failing to disclose significant climate risk to investors.”</p>



<p><strong>Amazon’s climate footprint exceeds its reporting efforts</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retail sector is responsible for <a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-retailer-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% </a>of global greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the largest U.S. retailers, including <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/esgreport/our-esg-priorities/2023%20CDP%20Climate%20Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mobilecontent.costco.com/staging/resource/img/25w03130/5a_ClimateActionPlan_FY24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco</a>* and <a href="https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/c70c48ab-0e10-4576-9e92-789e30665964/2023-CDP-Climate-Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target</a>,* already measure and report emissions from the majority of their products.</p>



<p>Amazon only discloses <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the emissions related to its Amazon-branded products</a>, which comprise <a href="https://www.momentumcommerce.com/amazons-private-label-market-share-shrinks-by-6-year-over-year-in-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 1% of its total sales</a>.&nbsp;This excludes a significant amount of Amazon’s products—and their climate impact.</p>



<p>“Despite Amazon being an <a href="https://nrf.com/research-insights/top-retailers/top-50-global-retailers/top-50-global-retailers-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international leader in retail sales</a>, the company lags in emissions reporting,” said<strong> Parker Caswell, </strong><strong>climate and energy senior associate at As You Sow</strong>. “This limited reporting makes Amazon’s emissions appear much smaller than they actually are.”</p>



<p>“Amazon’s lack of transparency about its climate pollution leaves investors in the dark about the company’s exposure to climate risk,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Information on risk is a foundation of disclosures and something every shareholder and potential shareholder deserves: The climate-related risks of Amazon’s total greenhouse gas emissions are no exception.”</p>
