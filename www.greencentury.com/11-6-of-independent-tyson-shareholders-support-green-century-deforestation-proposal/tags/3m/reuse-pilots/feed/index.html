<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Director of Communications, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, April 17, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Colgate-Palmolive*, a leading global consumer products </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3456/colgate-palmolive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will enhance its efforts to reduce plastic packaging and scale up reuse models that cut down on single-use plastic. In exchange for this heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Capital Management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction of total plastic packaging use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/10/breakingtheplasticwave_mainreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 million tons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of plastic waste is released into the ocean annually, </span><a href="https://conserveturtles.org/information-sea-turtles-threats-marine-debris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killing more than 1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marine animals each year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Colgate-Palmolive for stepping up its efforts to tackle the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Colgate-Palmolive to accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colgate-Palmolive’s planned actions include more thorough disclosure in future sustainability reports of </span><a href="https://www.colgatepalmolive.com/en-us/who-we-are/stories/plastic-commitments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reuse pilots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company has launched or planned, such as refillable jars for toothpaste tablets and Palmolive dish gel sold in refillable bottles. The company also will publish a “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its upcoming 2023 sustainability report and accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction that will prioritize packaging redesign and expansion of reuse and refill models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s clear that we can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Colgate-Palmolive significantly reduce its total contribution to plastic waste as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #008000;">States will make producers responsible for the waste they create</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s focus on plastic reduction comes not a moment too soon: a December 2022 survey found that 84% of registered U.S. voters support increasing the use of reusable packaging and foodware, and 80% support requiring companies to reduce their single-use </span><a href="https://usa.oceana.org/press-releases/americans-are-sick-of-single-use-plastic-pollution-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic packaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Governments are also taking note: since 2021, Maine, Oregon, California and Colorado have adopted the nation’s first producer responsibility laws for consumer packaging, which will make producers financially responsible for the packaging waste they create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our environment for centuries,” added Sanders. “Reuse and refill models, which </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rank among the most effective ways to replace single-use plastics, are critical solutions that companies must urgently scale up to meet one of the most profound environmental challenges of our time.” </span></p>
