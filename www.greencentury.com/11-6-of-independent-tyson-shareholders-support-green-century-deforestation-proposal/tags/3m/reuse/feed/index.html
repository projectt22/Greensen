					<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong><br />
Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800<br />
Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, November 13)</strong> Green Century° announced today that it has joined major investors in signing two letters urging action on the UN Global Plastics Treaty. <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/plastics-treaty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The UN Global Plastics Treaty</a>, due to be completed in 2024, would create a legally binding international agreement to cover the entire life cycle of plastics.</p>
<p>“UN member countries have a once in a lifetime opportunity to confront the plastics pollution crisis,” said<strong> Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</strong> “We strongly support the highest level of ambition in the Global Plastic Treaty.”</p>
<p>Plastic pollution is seen as a worldwide crisis and market failure. Nearly 400 million tons of plastics are produced annually, primarily from fossil fuels, creating a carbon footprint of approximately 1.8 billion tons of emissions each year. Plastic is also known to have negative impacts on environmental and human health at every stage of its lifecycle.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18554" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18554" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-18554" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Plastic-GHG-Emissions-Graphic-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18554" class="wp-caption-text">(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, EPA)</figcaption></figure>
<h4>The estimated annual greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production worldwide is more than the emissions from 400 million cars, or greater than of all the cars in North America combined.</h4>
<p>The letter from the Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development to the High Ambition Coalition, signed by Green Century and nearly 30 other institutional investors, urges countries to create a comprehensive, binding agreement to address global plastic design, production, and disposal. It also calls for investments in refillable bottle systems to replace single use plastics.</p>
<p>The second letter, CDP’s Open Letter to Governments, endorsed by 48 financial institutions with over $3.5 trillion AUM, calls for mandatory plastic data disclosure by all plastic producers globally.</p>
<p>Progress has been made in recent years on plastic disclosure, yet many investors, corporations, and governments are still largely unaware of the types and quantities of plastics being produced. Requirements for better transparency are complicated by the more than 13,000 commonly used plastic additives which impact human health and decrease recyclability.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18557" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-18557 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Graph-Chemicals-Plastic.png" alt="" width="480" height="236" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18557" class="wp-caption-text">The Health Impact of Chemical Additives to Plastic Are Largely Unknown and Unregulated</figcaption></figure>
<h4><strong>Of the over 13,000 chemical additives to plastic, over 70% have adverse impacts on human health or have not yet been the subject of scientific studies. </strong></h4>
<p>“The more you learn about plastics, the clearer the risks become,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century.</strong> “Plastic additives increase health and litigation risk for businesses and make plastic harder to recycle. After mandatory disclosure, the next steps are plastic reduction and commonsense solutions like refillable bottles.”</p>

<p><b>Boston, April 18, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keurig Dr. Pepper*, a leading global beverage company with brands from Snapple to 7Up, will boost efforts to cut single-use plastic by expanding its “reuse and refill” options across the country. In exchange for its heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction in total plastic packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of plastic flowing into our oceans is on pace to </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20plastic%20trash,to%2029%20million%20metric%20tons." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly triple by 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Keurig Dr. Pepper for stepping up its efforts to address the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keurig Dr. Pepper’s planned actions include expanding its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to include more details on refillable and reusable container pilots. Starting in 2023, the company pledged to publish an annual “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its CSR report. By 2024, the company plans to launch new reuse and refill pilots in key U.S. markets where the local infrastructure and culture are conducive to their success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Keurig Dr. Pepper help build a circular economy by providing more reuse options – from soda cups to K-Cup Pods – in communities across the U.S.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Companies such as Keurig Dr. Pepper are beginning to realize that an investment in reusable and refillable containers can mitigate the financial, regulatory, and reputational risks posed by single-use plastics,” added Sanders. “They’re also seeing consumers act, in growing numbers, on the common-sense conviction that nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our planet for hundreds of years.”</span></p>
