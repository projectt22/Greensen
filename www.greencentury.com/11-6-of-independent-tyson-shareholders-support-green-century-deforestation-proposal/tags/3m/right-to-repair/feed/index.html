<p class="has-text-align-left">Giovanna Eichner found the prospect of effecting change at companies as a worthy and compelling endeavor, so she jumped at a chance to join Green Century° in August as a shareholder advocate.<br><br>Green Century’s award-winning shareholder advocacy team of four people uses the Green Century’s stake as a shareholder to convince companies to change practices for the health of our planet. The team has won victories in a broad swath of issues and industries, including commitments to cut plastics use, protect forests, and reduce carbon footprints.<br><br>The David vs. Goliath dynamic reminded Giovanna of her environmental advocacy efforts at Boston College, where her student government helped convince the college to improve its environmental practices. Their efforts ranged from increasing funding for composting to cutting food waste.<br>“At Green Century, I saw a similar dynamic at play with advocacy and bigger institutions. I was really excited about pursuing climate policies in a way that was advantageous to both,” she said. “I think shareholder advocacy combines both of those elements and really values it.”<br><br><img decoding="async" width="301" height="226" class="wp-image-23532" style="width: 301px;" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France.jpeg 2420w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-1536x1153.jpeg 1536w, https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Giovanna-in-France-2048x1537.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" /><br><br>Giovanna said she works on climate issues across a dozen industries, ranging from footwear and apparel to insurance and fast-food restaurants. The companies she negotiates with are mostly big-name brands and are in industries that are high carbon emitters. She said Green Century’s strategy also resonated with her.<br><br>“Green Century’s approach is one where you’re looking to make the case to a big institution in a way that benefits them. You must understand and empathize with the other side and convince them that our values are aligned. That is how you get them to buy in!”<br><br>A Somerville resident, Giovanna looks forward to a chance to connect with people who work at Green Century’s nonprofit owners and partners that own the mutual fund firm on campaigns that overlap, and that helps amplify the impact of Funds investors.<br><br>“The nonprofit ownership really stood out to me,” she said. “It shows how Green Century aligns investments with its values by taking all its net profits back to ownership. I also see how collaboration extends beyond financing – there is potential for teamwork on <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">Right to Repair</a>, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/Plastics-2-pager-Indesign-file-6.30.2024_STAMPED-2-2.pdf">plastics</a> and other issues. We can really support each other. I like how Green Century not only has the values, but also exhibits this with action.&#8221;<br><br>Giovanna grew up in Rockville, Md., and double majored in German and history at Boston College. She taught English in Hamburg on a Fulbright grant for two years, working on community efforts to protect parklands and the diverse bird, plant and other ecological treasures.<br>Giovanna will help press companies for climate policies and practices that help the environment.

					<description><![CDATA[Our shareholder advocates have won successes in cutting plastics, carbon footprints and more from companies. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In 2024, Green Century held companies accountable and helped make change by convincing companies to share plastics use, disclose both direct and indirect carbon emissions and other environmental advances in the shareholder advocacy season. Here is a look at some of the <strong>Top 10 Highlights</strong> of our big year:</p>



<p><strong>1.&nbsp;<u><strong>Big</strong> Box Plastics:</u></strong> <strong>Costco*,</strong> the world’s third-largest retailer, agreed to make visible its plastic footprint for its signature Kirkland Brand products and unveiled a five-year action plan to reduce plastic packaging by year’s end.</p>

<p><strong><u>2.</u></strong><strong><u>Reducing Plastic Use: </u></strong>After our shareholder engagements, global entertainment giant <strong>Disney*</strong> and toymakers <strong>Hasbro* </strong>and <strong>Mattel*</strong>, hotels <strong>Marriott*</strong>, <strong>Hilton*</strong>, and <strong>Choice Hotels*</strong>, and other companies agreed to disclose their plastic footprints and/or set goals to cut plastic use.</p>

<p><strong>3. Protecting Nature:</strong> Green Century’s team filed a resolution at <strong>PepsiCo* </strong>urging the snack and beverage behemoth to address protecting nature and habitats. This was the first time shareholders of a publicly traded company voted on a proposal requesting a comprehensive biodiversity report.</p>

<p><strong><u>4. Safeguarding an Environmental Treasure</u></strong>: Green Century continued its multi-year effort to protect the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia from the threat of a proposed mine for titanium, a widely used pigment in paint, sunscreens and other products. The 438,000-acre refuge is a vital habitat for threatened and endangered species. Our shareholder resolutions at The <strong>Chemours Company*</strong>, <strong>Sherwin-Williams* </strong>and <strong>Home Depot* </strong>helped raise awareness and galvanize environmental leaders to protect this special place.</p>

<p><strong><u>5. Protecting Clean Air</u>: Lowe’s*</strong>, the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer, will share details on the planet-warming emissions from the products it sells in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century. This kind of disclosure is a key first step in cutting pollution from items such as lawncare equipment, which are often among the biggest polluters for retailers.</p>

<p><strong><u>6. Curbing Emissions:</u></strong> While <strong>IBM*</strong> has a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2030, the iconic computer giant was not setting rigorous science-based targets to reduce all of its climate pollution. Green Century’s proposal asking IBM to set comprehensive climate emissions targets won a whopping 31 percent of the votes at its annual meeting.</p>

<p><strong><u>7. Right to Repair</u></strong>: In a big win for the environment, Green Century worked with <strong>Microsoft Corp.* </strong>to extend the lifespan of its computers. In response to a proposal from Green Century, Microsoft announced it would extend Windows 10 security updates for organizations of all sizes, including schools, hospitals, and individuals. This move could prevent up to 400 million computers from becoming electronic waste in the coming years.</p>

<p><strong><u>8. Preserving Tropical Forests</u>: </strong>Global agribusiness giant <strong>Bunge* </strong>sources soy from South American tropical ecosystems such as the biodiverse Amazon and neighboring Cerrado savanna where jaguars, giant otters and other rare animals live. These are the last places we should be clearing forests for food. After negotiations with Green Century, Bunge agreed to strengthen protections for these special places.</p>

<p><strong><u>9. Climate Transition Plans</u></strong>: One of the world&#8217;s largest fossil fuel insurers in the world, had set an ambitious target to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its business. After engagement with Green Century, this company agreed to publish a road map, or climate transition plan, explaining how it will achieve its emissions reduction goals.</p>

<p><strong><u>10. Insurance Wins: </u></strong>Green Century pushed <strong>Chubb*</strong> to phase out insurance for new fossil fuel supplies. The company, which is the largest publicly traded commercial property and casualty insurer in the world and a major insurer of oil drilling off the coast of Brazil, announced in 2023 it would no longer write policies for new extraction or pipelines in conservation areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal, which received a 28% vote, asked Chubb to measure and disclose emissions associated with its underwriting, insurance, and investment-related activities. Secondly, Green Century filed a resolution, which received 38 percent of the vote, met with insurer <strong>Markel*</strong> to measure and disclose emissions associated with its underwriting, insurance, and investment-related activities.</p>

					<p><strong>(Boston) </strong>Microsoft Corporation* <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be offering extended security updates (ESU) for Microsoft Education customers at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century°</a>, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/microsoft-extends-security-support-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">pushed</a> Microsoft to announce affordable ESU for Windows 10 computers. This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest jump in junked computers ever</a>.</p>
<p>“This allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong>, President of <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century Funds</a>. “It is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.”</p>
<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/10/windows_11_adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">330-400 million devices</a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000 petition signatures</a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.</p>
<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.</p>
<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>
<p>“Getting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate. “We encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.”</p>

					<h3>SEC blocks Green Century<em>°</em> shareholder proposal on Right to Repair at Deere &amp; Company*</h3>
<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, </strong><a href="mailto:dguernsey@greencentury.com"><strong>dguernsey@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, </strong><a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com"><strong>ppodger@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p>(<strong>Boston, MA</strong>) Shareholders will not get to vote on Deere &amp; Company’s opposition to Right to Repair at the company’s Annual General Meeting this year after the SEC granted Deere’s no action request.</p>
<p>This is the second time shareholders of the tractor company have been denied a vote on a Green Century proposal because of an SEC no-action request.</p>
<p>“It is disappointing that Deere doesn’t want to allow shareholders to vote on this issue,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “Allowing farmers the right to repair their own equipment is common sense, and Deere’s opposition presents reputational risks to the brand. In the end, this may hurt investors.”</p>
<p>Green Century submitted a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/deere-co-faces-shareholder-scrutiny-on-right-to-repair-stand/">shareholder proposal</a> asking Deere to issue a public report on the benefits and drawbacks of opposing Right to Repair regulation and the financial and reputational risk associated with opposition in Q4 of 2023.</p>
<p>Deere’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcefdeere122923-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposition</a> was based on the argument that Green Century’s shareholder proposal would directly and negatively impact the Company’s ongoing “litigation strategy”.</p>
<p>Deere is currently the subject of a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1274486/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class action lawsuit</a> from farmers who allege that Deere and its authorized dealerships have “attempted monopolization, exclusionary conduct and restraint in the repair service market for John Deere brand agricultural equipment.”</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Pressure and Broad Bipartisan Support Continues to Grow for Right to Repair</strong></p>
<p>Bipartisan Right to Repair legislation, like that passed in Colorado which allows <a href="https://apnews.com/article/colorado-right-to-repair-farming-equipment-1da00ea957fd1057bf522cb4725e62d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farmers</a> and <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wheelchair</a> users access to fix their own equipment, has been gaining momentum in the United States and in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/congress-takes-on-right-to-repair-consumer-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple bills</a> have been introduced in Congress that would give consumers broader access to repair.</p>
<p>President Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/24/remarks-by-president-biden-before-meeting-with-the-white-house-competition-council/#:~:text=Too%20many%20areas%2C%20if%20you,It&#039;s%20broke." target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicated supporting consumer’s right to repair</a>, stating that too often “if you own a product, from a smartphone to a tractor, you don’t have the freedom to choose how or where the repair that item you purchased.”</p>
<p>In addition to reducing costs and downtime, access to repair helps spur competition.</p>
<p>Deere has opposed allowing independent repair shops and farmers to fix equipment sold by Deere, citing emissions control concerns. The <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/the-epa-finally-refutes-john-deere-dealership-arguments-against-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPA</a> has rejected these concerns, and advocates point out that if farmers are limited in their repair options, they face increased costs and may miss critical harvesting deadlines.</p>
<p>Last November, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/deere-must-face-us-farmers-right-to-repair-lawsuits-judge-rules-2023-11-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. District Judge</a> in Illinois stated that Deere must face claims that it had conspired to restrict repairs.</p>
<p>“Green Century will continue to advocate for the right to repair,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate working on the issue. “Access to repair not only benefits consumers and the economy, but it is a critical environmental issue. Extending the lifespan of our equipment is one of the largest environmental contributions someone can make as an individual.”</p>

					<h3>Green Century Pushed Microsoft to Extend Security Support to Prevent E-Waste</h3>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> &#8211; After engagement with <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century</a>°, Microsoft Corporation* announced it would extend Windows 10 security updates (ESU) for organizations of all sizes, including schools, the public sector, and for the first time, individuals. Microsoft will provide security updates options to devices using Windows 10 past their End of Support (EOS) date of October 14, 2025.</p>
<p>“Your computer shouldn’t become trash just because it can’t get a security update,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “Microsoft’s move may save vital institutions like hospitals and schools billions of dollars and could prevent millions of functioning computers from becoming toxic e-waste.”</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_18681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18681" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-18681" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Microsfot-300x158.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="158" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18681" class="wp-caption-text">Green Century Pushed Microsoft to Extend Security Support</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>An estimated 330-400 million devices may not be able to upgrade from Windows 10 because of hardware requirements. Microsoft planned End of Support (EOS) date could lead users to dispose of Windows devices which are not eligible to upgrade because of security concerns.</p>
<p>Reports brought to light and campaigns by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) have suggested that the End of Support for Windows 10 could cause the single biggest jump in junked computers ever.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s new Extended Security Update (ESU) program will cost a fee, the details of which will be released at a later date. The plan for commercial customers such as schools, the public sector, and small and mid-sized businesses will be available for three years. The consumer plan will be available initially for one year.</p>
<h3>Microsoft’s commitment is a good step forward, but the cost of the program could be a barrier to access and remains an issue.</h3>
<p>Critics are concerned that the undisclosed cost of ESUs may limit access to the ESU plan and thus reduce the program’s positive environmental impact. Experts suggest that 33% of computers using Windows 10 will not be able to update to Windows 11 because of hardware requirements. This could lead users to discard their devices prematurely out of concern for performance issues and exposure to security risks, which in turn will cause otherwise working computers to end up in landfills. E-waste is the fastest growing form of waste, yet only a small percentage of it is recycled.</p>
<p>“Microsoft is clearly thinking about its long-term environmental impact by extending critical security updates beyond the End of Support of Windows 10,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Now the company should make these important updates as widely accessible &#8211; and affordable &#8211; as possible.”</p>
<p>The vast majority of the environmental impact of electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry. According to the World Economic Forum, extending the lifespan of phones from three to four years could reduce the number of phones sent to waste by 25%.</p>

<h5>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495 Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800</h5>
<p><strong>(Boston, October 11)</strong> The Green Century° Equity Fund has filed a shareholder resolution with Deere &amp; Company* asking the company to issue a public report assessing the potential damage to the brand’s reputation from opposing Right to Repair legislation.</p>
<p>Deere, the iconic tractor company, has received significant scrutiny for its opposition to “Right to Repair” laws, which allow farmers to access diagnostic software, parts and instructions to repair their own machinery. A class-action lawsuit filed against Deere by farmers alleges that the company violated antitrust laws by restricting repair to dealerships, which increased company profits while hurting farmers.</p>
<p>Shareholders Concerned That Deere Is Not Doing Enough to Support Right to Repair</p>
<p>Recent polls indicate that an overwhelming 84% of Americans support Right to Repair legislation. In April 2023, Colorado became the first state to enact Right to Repair laws specifically targeting farm equipment. To date, 30 additional states have introduced Right to Repair bills, highlighting the growing momentum behind the issue.</p>
<p>While Deere recently signed a “memorandum of understanding” (MOU) with The American Farm Bureau Federation which would allow farmers to buy access to repair information, the agreement has come under scrutiny. According to the MOU, the Farm Bureau would be restricted from advocating for enforceable legislation, and Deere would be allowed to pull out of the agreement if any legislation is passed.</p>
<h3>Deere Opposed Right to Repair on Flimsy Grounds</h3>
<p>There are also concerns that in its rush to oppose Right to Repair legislation, Deere may have made misleading statements in federal filings regarding the environmental consequences of repair.</p>
<p>Deere claimed that existing EPA regulations and the Clean Air Act were some of the reasons that it would not give independent repair shops access to its diagnostic tools. In August 2023, however, the EPA issued a statement that it had no policy on restricting owners’ repairs of emissions-related components of their products to properly function.</p>
<p>Green Century previously filed a shareholder proposal with Deere on the same issue in 2021. Shareholders were unable to vote on the measure as Deere petitioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to exclude the proposal from the ballot. At the time, Green Century° President Leslie Samuelrich said, “Deere seems to be more focused on stifling shareholder concerns than addressing them. Spending time and energy on an SEC challenge could be put to better use by making their products better serve their customers.”</p>

<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495<br />
Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA, 2023) &#8211; </strong>Following shareholder engagement by Green Century°, Alphabet* announced that it plans to extend software updates for Chromebooks for up to ten years starting in 2024, and that no existing Chromebooks will expire in the next two years. It is estimated the changes in policy could impact up to 120 million computers currently on the market.</p>
<p>The multiple year extension by the parent company of Google* allows schools and families to keep functioning Chromebooks to remain in use, preventing those items from becoming e-waste.</p>
<p>“This is a major win for the environment, schools, and the shareholder advocacy process,” said Douglass Guernsey, a Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management. “By extending the life of Chromebooks commonly used in schools, Alphabet is getting ahead of addressing potential risks and making sure hardware using its software can be used for as long as possible.”</p>
<h3><strong>Green Century and Consumer Activists Help Consumers and School Districts</strong></h3>
<p>Green Century discuss risks raised by the “<a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PIRG-Chromebook-Churn-Full-Report-May-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook Churn</a>” published by <a href="https://pirg.org/resources/what-is-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIRG</a> (Public Interest Research Groups) directly with Alphabet management in Summer 2023. Chromebook’s “Auto Update Expiration” date would cause millions of Chromebooks to stop working even if the hardware was still functioning. The report showed that extending the life of Chromebooks could result in <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/chromebook-churn-report-highlights-problems-of-short-lived-laptops-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 billion dollars</a> in savings for taxpayers and could save millions of tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Green Century has previously engaged Alphabet on improving reparability of its <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-withdraws-right-to-repair-shareholder-proposal-after-google-parent-alphabet-agrees-to-make-pixel-replacement-parts-available/">Pixel phones</a> and disclosing details of the company’s <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/google-parent-alphabet-pledges-greater-transparency-on-use-of-carbon-offsets-after-green-century-shareholder-proposal-2/">carbon offsets</a>. Both previous engagements resulted in changes from management to address environmental concerns.</p>

					<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA, 2023)</strong> In a reversal of its stance, <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc.*</a> announced Wednesday that it now supports the Right to Repair Act progressing through the California Legislature despite past opposition to giving consumers and repair shops the tools they need to fix devices.</p>
<p>Introduced by state Sen. Susan Eggman (D-Stockton), <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate Bill 244</a> would make it easier and cheaper to get consumer electronics and appliances fixed. Under the bill, manufacturers like Apple must provide consumers or independent repair shops with sufficient documentation, tools, and parts. This bill would also reduce the e-waste currently filling landfills as consumers would be able to repair instead of discarding or upgrading their devices.</p>
<p>Apple, <a href="https://www.fool.com/research/largest-companies-by-market-cap/#:~:text=of%20August%202023.-,Key%20findings,and%20Amazon%20(%241.32%20trillion)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest company in the world</a>, had previously opposed allowing users to repair its products, until Green Century and others began negotiations with the company. Green Century’s engagement<a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/"> helped secure an agreement with Apple in 2021</a> that stated, for the first time, that Apple would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products.</p>
<p>“We are excited that Apple has announced its support for this important legislation and recognize this is a major step forward for the company,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate with Green Century Capital Management. “By supporting this legislation, Apple is sending a strong message that repairing, not replacing products, is good for consumers, good for the environment, and good for investors.”</p>
<p><strong>California Legislation Part of National Momentum</strong></p>
<p>Apple indicated its support for offering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely, while ensuring they wouldn’t risk privacy or data issues.</p>
<p>“Apple supports California’s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy,” the company says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</a></p>
<p>The bill specifies that the duration of a manufacturer’s obligation would depend on the product’s cost. Those with a wholesale price of at least $50 would have a shorter time than products that cost more than $100, where the bill specifies that access to documentation tools and parts must be available for seven years.</p>
<p>The California State Assembly has been debating the bill and a vote is expected shortly in the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The bill cleared the state Senate in May by a 38-0 vote.</p>
<p>California has been a leader in the Right to Repair movement, with momentum increasing nationally as lawmakers from about 14 states have introduced similar bills. <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/right-to-repair-in-2022-what-happened-in-new-york-and-our-top-accomplishments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York</a>, <a href="https://pirg.org/updates/colorado-tractor-right-to-repair-signed-into-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colorado </a>and <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/minnesota-passes-broadest-right-to-repair-measure-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minnesota</a> all passed their own Right to Repair laws in the past year.</p>
<p>A coalition <a href="https://pirg.org/california/updates/82-repair-shops-sign-letter-in-support-of-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of 82 repair shops have rallied behind the bill, which was backed by CalPIRG</a>, one of the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ownership-2-pager-6.30.23.pdf">nonprofit owners</a> of Green Century.</p>
<p><a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/repair-saves-families-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to research by PIRG</a>, the average American family generates about 115 pounds of electronic waste each year, and nationally, the United States generates 6.9 million tons of electronic waste.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green Century Funds° helps investors make an impact for the planet through a sustainable investing strategy, partners with its investment advisor in an award-winning shareholder advocacy program, and a unique ownership model that sends 100% of our net profits to support the environmental campaign work of our nonprofit owners.</p>
<p>One question we often get is, “How do you decide what issues to work on”?</p>
<p>This is an excellent question. There’s no shortage of issues facing our environment, and it can be hard to decide where to start making a difference. The good news is that while our planet may have more problems than it deserves, we’re finding more solutions every day to help fix them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17905" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="177" /></p>
<p>Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. Shareholder advocacy is a tool used by investors to push a company to report on or change a policy. Green Century negotiates with companies to improve their sustainability practices by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, protecting ocean wildlife from plastic pollution, adopting sustainable agriculture policies and more. Then, once companies make commitments, we assess their progress and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>To choose our priority issues, we evaluate a number of factors. First, we’re Green Century Funds for a reason – we’re all about protecting the environment. So, our first consideration is, how can we make the biggest impact for the planet? These issues run the gamut from stopping global warming, protecting endangered species, preserving forests or reducing plastic waste. We evaluate today’s most pressing issues which, if we can win concrete changes to corporate policy, will produce the most profound benefits for ecosystems around the world?</p>
<p>Then, we think about our comparative advantage. Where can we uniquely advance change? Where does our expertise lie? What emerging frameworks and targets can companies implement to mitigate environmental risks? On which issues can we make the strongest business case for action?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19274 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/raze-solar-pIcseKMisrs-unsplash-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p>At the end of the day, there’s no one issue that merits all of our attention; the threats facing our planet are multifaceted and ever evolving. But one thing we do know is that to ensure we have a planet to operate businesses on in the future, companies need to figure out now how to give back more than they take. And since nature is everybody&#8217;s business, there&#8217;s no company that can stand on the sidelines.</p>
<p>This coming shareholder season, which runs on a schedule similar to a school year, we’re focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting forests around the world by convincing food and consumer goods companies to protect biodiversity by addressing their nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, as well as by establishing science-based targets for nature that will protect our planet for generations to come.</li>
<li>Reducing plastic pollution by pressing companies to use less plastic in their packaging, especially new plastic, and to scale up reuse models that will help drive a circular economy.</li>
<li>Asking companies that have set goals to reduce their contribution to climate change to develop climate transition plans that chart how the company will hit their targets and move toward a clean energy economy.</li>
<li>Expanding the number of companies with Right to Repair policies that help consumers and reduce dangerous electronic waste.</li>
<li>Pressing insurance companies – which, ironically, are pulling coverage from areas prone to natural disasters exacerbated by extreme weather – to stop underwriting the new fossil fuel projects driving extreme weather in the first place.</li>
<li>Protecting animal welfare by asking companies to institute more humane policies such as eliminating gestation crates.</li>
<li>Pushing major retailers to phase out gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric lawn equipment to improve air quality and cut off another key contributor to climate change.<br />
A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[(Boston, MA) &#8211; In a positive development for the Right to Repair movement, technology giant Apple Inc* announced it would expand its Self Service Repair program to its newest iPhone [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<p>(Boston, MA) &#8211; In a positive development for the Right to Repair movement, technology giant <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Inc</a>* announced it would expand its Self Service Repair program to its newest iPhone 14 and M2 Mac models. The company’s continued commitment is a win for consumer rights and efforts to combat e-waste and came after <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century Funds</a>°, a leading environmentally responsible family of mutual funds, advocated for increasing sustainable business practices at the company.</p>
<p>Green Century initiated discussions with Apple in 2021 and submitted a shareholder proposal later that year asking the company to consider the environmental and social benefits of making its devices more easily repairable by consumers and independent repair shops.</p>
<h2><strong>Green Century Advocacy Creates Long-Term Impact for the Environment </strong></h2>
<p>Through a series of collaborative meetings, Green Century provided Apple with compelling evidence on the positive environmental implications of allowing customers to repair instead of replacing their products. Repairs extend the life of products, help reduce electronic and plastic waste, promote a more circular economy, and aligns Apple’s policy on the issue with its own sustainability goals and commitments.</p>
<p>Green Century’s efforts helped to culminate in Apple announcing for the first time in 2021 that it would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products. Green Century withdrew its shareholder proposal in return for Apple’s commitments.</p>
<p>“True to its slogan, Apple is “Thinking Different” by helping to reduce electronic waste and helping customers hold on to their products longer. Green Century is proud to have played a role in Apple&#8217;s evolving support for Right to Repair and hope that their leadership moves its competitors to follow suit,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</p>
<p>Apple and other technology companies traditionally have lobbied against Right to Repair legislation, so the announcement of its expanded repair commitments carries substantial weight in industry discussions. Americans spend around <a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1,700</a> per household a year purchasing new electronic devices, and nearly<a href="https://pirg.org/california/resources/repair-saves-families-big-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 7 million tons</a> of American <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/what-is-e-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic e-waste</a> end up in landfills each year.</p>
