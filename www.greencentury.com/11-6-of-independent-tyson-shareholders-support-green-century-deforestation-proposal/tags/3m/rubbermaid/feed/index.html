<p><strong>Boston, March 24, 2022 – </strong>Green Century<em>°</em> has withdrawn a shareholder proposal with Newell Brands, maker of such popular consumer products as Rubbermaid storage containers, Sharpie markers and Coleman outdoor gear. This came after the company committed to reducing the impact of its plastic packaging use.</p>



<p>In the withdrawal agreement it signed with Green Century, Newell committed to setting a goal to achieve at least 20% non-virgin plastic packaging for the manufactured goods portion of its product portfolio.</p>



<p>The company will also begin an assessment of the packaging materials used across the sourced finished goods portion of its product portfolio so that it can expand its focus on sustainable packaging to more of its products. Newell intends to eliminate unnecessary packaging components and transition away from plastics where possible.</p>



<p>“Plastic packaging can pose material risks to companies, so we are pleased to see Newell take this step toward reducing the impact of its plastic use,” said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “We encourage the company to take its efforts a step farther in the future by setting a measurable goal for absolute plastic reduction.”</p>



<p>This effort was recently announced in Newell’s <a href="https://newell.brightspotcdn.com/bf/39/2f16a54b400db56dd2a53d317ff3/newell-ccr-report-2021-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Corporate Citizenship Report</a>. Manufactured goods refers to products made by Newell, while sourced finished goods are produced by third-party manufacturers.</p>



<p>Around 11 million metric tons of plastic pollute the ocean every year, and if plastic production is not significantly curtailed, annual pollution could reach 29 million metric tons by 2040. Polluted plastics kill more than 1 million marine animals every year and may be inhibiting the ocean’s ability to sequester carbon, an ecosystem service critical to meeting the world’s climate goals.</p>
