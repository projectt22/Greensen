<p><strong>Boston, June 11, 2025 </strong>– Columbia Sportswear’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century<em>° </em>shareholder proposal requesting that the company set climate emissions reduction targets. The proposal received 7.9% of votes cast.</p>



<p>“Columbia would better serve its investors and bottom line by cutting its climate impact, like so many of its peers have done,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Climate action is a priority for many of Columbia’s outdoorsy customers, so it should be a priority for Columbia.”</p>



<p><a></a>In 2020, the owner of several active lifestyle brands <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/309/columbia-sportswear-company-releases-2020-corporate?ef_id=2efa76054317110b878d1542bfa78f26%3AG%3As" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to cut the climate footprint</a> of its manufacturing by 30%, but the company quietly stopped reporting on its commitment in 2022. Columbia has not indicated that it will adopt a new goal to keep up with the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">649 </a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footwear and apparel companies</a> that have agreed to or already set science-based emissions reduction targets as of May 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Columbia falls behind its mission and peers</strong></p>



<p><a></a>Without action, the footwear and apparel industry by 2050 could account for <a href="https://content.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/m/7f818b40f06e1afd/original/Summary-of-findings-A-New-Textiles-Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a quarter</a> of the global climate emissions necessary to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/2024-was-warmest-year-modern-record-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 was the warmest year</a> on record and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/when-risks-become-reality-extreme-weather-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists say</a> climate change added 41 days of dangerous heat and worsened the severity of flooding.</p>



<p>Consumer concern about climate change is rising with the temperature. A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PricewaterhouseCoopers survey</a> found that more than 80% of consumers say they are willing to pay more for sustainably produced goods, and some would be willing to pay 9.7% more for goods that meet environmental standards. Nine out of ten Gen Zers born between 1996 and 2010 believe that companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-gen-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey study</a>.</p>



<p>Columbia’s mission is to “unlock the outdoors for everyone.” Nevertheless, while Columbia stays silent on climate commitments, its competitors &#8212; including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia,</a> <a href="https://www.vfc.com/responsibility/planet/climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VF Corp</a>*, and <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/meet-brooks/running-responsibly/climate-action/?srsltid=AfmBOoqMK8jgLJzsGhpwmQ2R1kjF11jnwNMHvdGvMjxHHUFWqxm91UWJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooks</a> &#8212; have set climate emissions reduction goals that demonstrate they are working to protect the environment their customers value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Columbia <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/372/columbia-sportswear-company-reports-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=our%20conference%20call.-,ACCELERATE%20Growth%20Strategy,as%20enhanced%20ways%20of%20working." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to attract</a> young, active consumers, yet it has backtracked on its ambition to protect the very outdoors they want to experience,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The company could boost its reputation and competitive edge if it took further steps to protect Earth, not just use it in its advertising.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 – </strong>5.7% of shareholder votes were cast in favor of a shareholder proposal asking Foot Locker* to set climate emissions reduction targets at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. Green Century° and <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a><em> </em>filed the proposal.  </p>



<p>“Without climate targets, investors are in the dark about Foot Locker’s plans to mitigate climate risk,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Setting a goal to cut planet-warming emissions shows that Foot Locker is working to reduce its climate impact, not just measure it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/f4606fc1-6d5b-46c9-b175-2cd50429c30e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker committed</a> to setting climate emissions reduction targets and a net-zero goal in response to an <em>As You Sow </em>shareholder proposal. The company quietly retracted its commitment this year in its <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact report</a> and has not shared plans to adopt new climate targets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Climate change threatens footwear and apparel companies&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Footwear and apparel companies are expected to experience significant impacts as climate change intensifies. Asia is the “<a href="https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/asia-still-garment-factory-world-yet-faces-numerous-challenges-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garment factory of the world</a>,” according to the International Labor Organization, as well as the world’s <a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-asia-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most disaster-prone region</a>. Climate disasters could <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-state-of-fashion-2024-report-climate-crisis-supply-chain-sustainability-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten $65 billion worth of apparel exports</a> from countries critical to footwear and apparel production by 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/node/21641/html#item1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s disclosures</a> warn that climate-related hazards could disrupt production and delivery. The vast majority of <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s suppliers</a> for its brand-named products, totaling 90 percent, are sourced from climate-vulnerable countries in Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Foot Locker out of step with industry</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six hundred and forty footwear and apparel retailers, such as <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/impact/initiatives/reducing-our-carbon-footprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nike*,</a> <a href="https://sustainability.decathlon.com/what-action-plan-is-needed-to-reduce-absolute-co2-eq-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decathalon</a> and <a href="https://www.jdplc.com/esg/environment/climate-change/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JD Sports</a>, have set or committed to setting science-based targets to reduce their climate emissions and associated risks. <a href="https://earth.org/what-is-the-united-nations-fashion-industry-charter-for-climate-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nearly 130 apparel companies</a> have signed on to the <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/sectoral-engagement-for-climate-action/fashion-charter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Nation’s Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,</a> which requires adopting science-based targets and collaborating on plans to reach them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Foot Locker’s prior pledge recognized the role it can play in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change on its business and the Earth,” <strong>said Danielle Fugere, president and chief counsel of <em>As You Sow</em></strong>. “Recommitting to greenhouse gas reduction targets would allow Foot Locker to address the growing impacts of climate change and better compete with its peers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As climate emissions increase, so does economic risk, &#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“Investors want Foot Locker to lace up its shoes and catch up to the industry in reducing its carbon footprint.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Green Century Capital Management Inc.</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a leader in the environmentally responsible investing field. Green Century provides mutual funds for individuals and institutions to keep their money out of the most environmentally harmful industries.

<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 </strong>– 5.1% of voting shares were cast on Wednesday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking Wendy’s for more details on how the company will achieve its sustainability goals. The fast food chain has pledged to reduce the climate impact of emissions drivers such as beef production across farms, franchises and other links in its supply chain.</p>



<p>“Investors want to know Wendy&#8217;s has a viable strategy to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Plans that directly address the highest-emitting parts of Wendy’s business are critical to making its climate roadmap a reality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef is a major climate emitter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all the goods Wendy’s purchases, beef is the main offender in increasing emissions. The United Nations reports that beef <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emits</a> more greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram than any other food. <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beef accounts for 58%</a> of the total emissions from the goods and services Wendy’s purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendys-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2023</a>, Wendy&#8217;s announced its first goals to reduce emissions from purchased goods and services and franchises by 2030. Reducing the climate footprint of its “fresh, never frozen” burgers is key to Wendy’s reaching its new, <a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> climate </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targets</a>, and the company identifies <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beef as one of four emissions </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot spots</a>.” Nevertheless, emissions from Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2024-05/Wendys-2023-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased goods and services have increased</a> since 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Wendy’s climate plans lack key details</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wendy’s sustainability report highlights steps to <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve its climate commitment— primarily through increasing innovation</a> rather than decreasing beef consumption.

<p><strong>Boston, May 7, 2025</strong> – 16.3% of Wolverine Worldwide, Inc.* investors cast their votes Thursday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to establish science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. Wolverine is the owner of several leading footwear and apparel brands, including Merrell, Saucony and Chaco.</p>



<p>“Ambitious climate targets lead to ambitious climate action,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Investors want Wolverine to not only disclose its climate emissions but also to set targets to reduce them on pace with the rest of the industry and in line with effective climate risk mitigation.”</p>



<p>Wolverine trails peers in disclosing its climate emissions and adopting science-based emissions reduction targets. While the goal of its brands is to bring consumers into the outdoors, Wolverine is not adequately protecting the natural places its customers value.</p>



<p><strong>The footwear and apparel industry is a major climate polluter</strong></p>



<p><a></a>According to some estimates, the footwear and apparel industry worldwide is responsible for more emissions than <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/fashion-on-climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined</a>. Therefore, Wolverine’s lack of emissions reduction targets may worry consumers &#8212; especially younger, increasingly climate-conscious customers &#8212; who understand the harmful impacts of growing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M</a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ore than</a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 10,000 companies</a>, 627 of which are in the footwear and apparel industry, have set or committed to setting science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. By adopting climate goals, these companies may better demonstrate that they are trying to decrease the threat climate change poses to their businesses and the planet.</p>



<p>“Wolverine should join its peers in more meaningfully tackling climate risk,” <strong>said Green Century shareholder advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Setting science-based targets would help Wolverine mitigate the financial, reputational, and systemic risks posed by climate change and ultimately advance the company’s efforts to protect the planet its customers seek to enjoy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Though IBM has committed to reducing a percentage of its overall climate emissions, it has refused to set a target that covers all of its operational and upstream and downstream emissions, also known as a science-based target.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Our proposal addresses a yawning gap between what IBM does and what it says,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “IBM speaks of the </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/science-based-targets-what-are-the-key-commitments-required/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">transformative power of science-based targets</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> on its website, but it won’t set its own comprehensive target.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">IBM has demonstrated decades-long leadership on climate issues. As early as 1994, it began to disclose its carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, it first purchased renewable electricity in 2001, publicly supported the Paris Agreement in 2015, and backed a bi-partisan plan for a carbon tax in 2019. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, the company’s recent actions undermine its credibility. Even though IBM has a </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/files/reports-policies/2023/IBM_2023_ESG_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">target to substantially reduce its emissions by 2030</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, the target only covers a few categories of its emissions sources. Meanwhile, peers’ targets cover a much wider scope of emissions, including those of Hewlett Packard Enterprise*, Microsoft*, and Salesforce*.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I can’t think of another company that has more to gain by establishing science-based targets and implementing them,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “You simply can’t maintain your leadership position in the industry, while ducking a commitment yourself. The reputational risk is breathtaking.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
