<p><strong>Boston, June 11, 2025 </strong>– Columbia Sportswear’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century<em>° </em>shareholder proposal requesting that the company set climate emissions reduction targets. The proposal received 7.9% of votes cast.</p>



<p>“Columbia would better serve its investors and bottom line by cutting its climate impact, like so many of its peers have done,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Climate action is a priority for many of Columbia’s outdoorsy customers, so it should be a priority for Columbia.”</p>



<p><a></a>In 2020, the owner of several active lifestyle brands <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/309/columbia-sportswear-company-releases-2020-corporate?ef_id=2efa76054317110b878d1542bfa78f26%3AG%3As" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledged to cut the climate footprint</a> of its manufacturing by 30%, but the company quietly stopped reporting on its commitment in 2022. Columbia has not indicated that it will adopt a new goal to keep up with the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">649 </a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footwear and apparel companies</a> that have agreed to or already set science-based emissions reduction targets as of May 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Columbia falls behind its mission and peers</strong></p>



<p><a></a>Without action, the footwear and apparel industry by 2050 could account for <a href="https://content.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/m/7f818b40f06e1afd/original/Summary-of-findings-A-New-Textiles-Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a quarter</a> of the global climate emissions necessary to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/2024-was-warmest-year-modern-record-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024 was the warmest year</a> on record and <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/when-risks-become-reality-extreme-weather-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientists say</a> climate change added 41 days of dangerous heat and worsened the severity of flooding.</p>



<p>Consumer concern about climate change is rising with the temperature. A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2024/pwc-2024-voice-of-consumer-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PricewaterhouseCoopers survey</a> found that more than 80% of consumers say they are willing to pay more for sustainably produced goods, and some would be willing to pay 9.7% more for goods that meet environmental standards. Nine out of ten Gen Zers born between 1996 and 2010 believe that companies have a responsibility to address environmental and social issues, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-gen-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey study</a>.</p>



<p>Columbia’s mission is to “unlock the outdoors for everyone.” Nevertheless, while Columbia stays silent on climate commitments, its competitors &#8212; including <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/climate-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patagonia,</a> <a href="https://www.vfc.com/responsibility/planet/climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VF Corp</a>*, and <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/meet-brooks/running-responsibly/climate-action/?srsltid=AfmBOoqMK8jgLJzsGhpwmQ2R1kjF11jnwNMHvdGvMjxHHUFWqxm91UWJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooks</a> &#8212; have set climate emissions reduction goals that demonstrate they are working to protect the environment their customers value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Columbia <a href="https://investor.columbia.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/372/columbia-sportswear-company-reports-first-quarter-2025#:~:text=our%20conference%20call.-,ACCELERATE%20Growth%20Strategy,as%20enhanced%20ways%20of%20working." target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants to attract</a> young, active consumers, yet it has backtracked on its ambition to protect the very outdoors they want to experience,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The company could boost its reputation and competitive edge if it took further steps to protect Earth, not just use it in its advertising.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 – </strong>5.7% of shareholder votes were cast in favor of a shareholder proposal asking Foot Locker* to set climate emissions reduction targets at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. Green Century° and <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a><em> </em>filed the proposal.  </p>



<p>“Without climate targets, investors are in the dark about Foot Locker’s plans to mitigate climate risk,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Setting a goal to cut planet-warming emissions shows that Foot Locker is working to reduce its climate impact, not just measure it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/f4606fc1-6d5b-46c9-b175-2cd50429c30e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker committed</a> to setting climate emissions reduction targets and a net-zero goal in response to an <em>As You Sow </em>shareholder proposal. The company quietly retracted its commitment this year in its <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact report</a> and has not shared plans to adopt new climate targets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Climate change threatens footwear and apparel companies&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Footwear and apparel companies are expected to experience significant impacts as climate change intensifies. Asia is the “<a href="https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/asia-still-garment-factory-world-yet-faces-numerous-challenges-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garment factory of the world</a>,” according to the International Labor Organization, as well as the world’s <a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-asia-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most disaster-prone region</a>. Climate disasters could <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/sustainability/the-state-of-fashion-2024-report-climate-crisis-supply-chain-sustainability-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten $65 billion worth of apparel exports</a> from countries critical to footwear and apparel production by 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/node/21641/html#item1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s disclosures</a> warn that climate-related hazards could disrupt production and delivery. The vast majority of <a href="https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/static-files/6a51d02e-eef5-4b42-9ed6-7728df9dcfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foot Locker’s suppliers</a> for its brand-named products, totaling 90 percent, are sourced from climate-vulnerable countries in Asia.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Foot Locker out of step with industry</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six hundred and forty footwear and apparel retailers, such as <a href="https://about.nike.com/en/impact/initiatives/reducing-our-carbon-footprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nike*,</a> <a href="https://sustainability.decathlon.com/what-action-plan-is-needed-to-reduce-absolute-co2-eq-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decathalon</a> and <a href="https://www.jdplc.com/esg/environment/climate-change/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JD Sports</a>, have set or committed to setting science-based targets to reduce their climate emissions and associated risks. <a href="https://earth.org/what-is-the-united-nations-fashion-industry-charter-for-climate-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nearly 130 apparel companies</a> have signed on to the <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/sectoral-engagement-for-climate-action/fashion-charter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Nation’s Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action,</a> which requires adopting science-based targets and collaborating on plans to reach them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Foot Locker’s prior pledge recognized the role it can play in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change on its business and the Earth,” <strong>said Danielle Fugere, president and chief counsel of <em>As You Sow</em></strong>. “Recommitting to greenhouse gas reduction targets would allow Foot Locker to address the growing impacts of climate change and better compete with its peers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As climate emissions increase, so does economic risk, &#8221; <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“Investors want Foot Locker to lace up its shoes and catch up to the industry in reducing its carbon footprint.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Green Century Capital Management Inc.</strong></a><strong> </strong>is a leader in the environmentally responsible investing field. Green Century provides mutual funds for individuals and institutions to keep their money out of the most environmentally harmful industries.

<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 10.5% of McDonald’s* shareholders cast their votes in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to assess whether its existing climate policies and plans are sufficient to achieve its emissions reduction targets. The resolution, which went to the ballot Tuesday, requests details on McDonald’s progress toward reaching its net-zero emissions by 2050 goal</p>



<p>“McDonald’s commitment to reducing carbon pollution shows that the company understands the risks that a warming planet poses to its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Now, McDonald’s must assure investors that it will live up to its commitments and take the necessary steps to meaningfully reduce climate-related risks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef has an outsized climate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/food-systems-responsible-for-one-third-of-human-caused-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our food system</a> accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and few meals we eat contribute to those emissions more than a burger. The life cycle of beef from farm to fork<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emits more greenhouse gas emissions</a> per kilogram than any other food, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular fast-food restaurants can play a key role in addressing climate change by buying and selling beef produced with processes that reduce emissions. Chains including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have added alternative-protein patties to their menus. Diversifying protein options to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption of beef is one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical method to cutting climate emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>McDonald’s </strong><strong>is slow </strong><strong>to show progress&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s set short- and long-term targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with what science says is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Because beef makes up about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/the-carbon-footprint-of-mcdonald-s-menu-very-big" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of the company&#8217;s total climate footprint</a>, reducing beef-related emissions is an impactful strategy to achieve its climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the climate risks of increasing emissions, McDonald’s is exposing itself to reputational risk by failing to illustrate it is on track to meet its climate commitments. <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/greenwashing-rising-report-rep-risk-social-washing-sustainability/696289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental groups </a>have suggested companies, <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/mcdonalds-greenwashing-2655223811.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including McDonald’s</a>, may be misleading customers about the extent of their climate action, a phenomenon called “greenwashing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 22, 2025 </strong>– 5.1% of voting shares were cast on Wednesday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking Wendy’s for more details on how the company will achieve its sustainability goals. The fast food chain has pledged to reduce the climate impact of emissions drivers such as beef production across farms, franchises and other links in its supply chain.</p>



<p>“Investors want to know Wendy&#8217;s has a viable strategy to mitigate climate risk,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Plans that directly address the highest-emitting parts of Wendy’s business are critical to making its climate roadmap a reality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef is a major climate emitter&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of all the goods Wendy’s purchases, beef is the main offender in increasing emissions. The United Nations reports that beef <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emits</a> more greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram than any other food. <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beef accounts for 58%</a> of the total emissions from the goods and services Wendy’s purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendys-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In 2023</a>, Wendy&#8217;s announced its first goals to reduce emissions from purchased goods and services and franchises by 2030. Reducing the climate footprint of its “fresh, never frozen” burgers is key to Wendy’s reaching its new, <a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ambitious</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> climate </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendysr-square-deal-blog/wendys-2024-corporate-responsibility-progress-update-across-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targets</a>, and the company identifies <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beef as one of four emissions </a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“</a><a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot spots</a>.” Nevertheless, emissions from Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2024-05/Wendys-2023-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased goods and services have increased</a> since 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Wendy’s climate plans lack key details</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wendy’s sustainability report highlights steps to <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve its climate commitment— primarily through increasing innovation</a> rather than decreasing beef consumption. The company cites manure management and feed efficiency as key initiatives to cut emissions but lacks details about how specific projects, collaborations, or investments will make its emissions reduction plans a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Competitors including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have already taken steps that will reduce emissions from beef, such as introducing alternative proteins to their menus. Burger King’s Impossible<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Whopper <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/responsible-sourcing/beef-cow-methane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generates 89% fewer emissions</a> than a beef burger, helping the restaurant reach its own <a href="https://www.rbi.com/English/sustainability/planet/climate-action/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">climate commitment</a>. Although Wendy’s <a href="https://www.wendys.com/sites/default/files/2025-04/Wendys-2024-Corporate-Responsibility-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features “product mix”</a> as part of its roadmap to reduce emissions, it does not describe what this strategy entails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wendy’s ambition to reduce its climate footprint will only benefit its business if it becomes reality,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Investors want to know more details on how the company plans to hit its climate goals. In other words, where’s the beef?”&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 7, 2025</strong> – 16.3% of Wolverine Worldwide, Inc.* investors cast their votes Thursday in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to establish science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. Wolverine is the owner of several leading footwear and apparel brands, including Merrell, Saucony and Chaco.</p>



<p>“Ambitious climate targets lead to ambitious climate action,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Investors want Wolverine to not only disclose its climate emissions but also to set targets to reduce them on pace with the rest of the industry and in line with effective climate risk mitigation.”</p>



<p>Wolverine trails peers in disclosing its climate emissions and adopting science-based emissions reduction targets. While the goal of its brands is to bring consumers into the outdoors, Wolverine is not adequately protecting the natural places its customers value.</p>



<p><strong>The footwear and apparel industry is a major climate polluter</strong></p>



<p><a></a>According to some estimates, the footwear and apparel industry worldwide is responsible for more emissions than <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/fashion-on-climate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined</a>. Therefore, Wolverine’s lack of emissions reduction targets may worry consumers &#8212; especially younger, increasingly climate-conscious customers &#8212; who understand the harmful impacts of growing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M</a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ore than</a><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 10,000 companies</a>, 627 of which are in the footwear and apparel industry, have set or committed to setting science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. By adopting climate goals, these companies may better demonstrate that they are trying to decrease the threat climate change poses to their businesses and the planet.</p>



<p>“Wolverine should join its peers in more meaningfully tackling climate risk,” <strong>said Green Century shareholder advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Setting science-based targets would help Wolverine mitigate the financial, reputational, and systemic risks posed by climate change and ultimately advance the company’s efforts to protect the planet its customers seek to enjoy.”&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					
<p><strong>Boston, May 2, 2025</strong> – A Green Century° shareholder proposal urging The Timken Company* to adopt science-based targets to reduce its climate emissions received 8.91% of votes cast at the company’s annual meeting on Friday. The Ohio-based steel bearing manufacturer is a key supplier for the global automotive, rail, renewable energy and agricultural industries.</p>



<p>“Timken needs to meaningfully address its negative impact on climate change, not just trim emissions from a small portion of its business,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Addressing climate emissions from its supply chain will help Timken meet the expectations of its customers and investors to mitigate climate-related risks.”</p>



<p>Like many companies with global operations, Timken’s supply chain may be increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. <a href="https://impact.economist.com/projects/trade-in-transition/climate_change/" data-type="link" data-id="https://impact.economist.com/projects/trade-in-transition/climate_change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The frequency of billion-dollar weather events</a> has increased from once every four months to once every three weeks in just a decade. These floods, hurricanes, droughts and other severe weather disrupt the manufacturing and transport activities that companies, including Timken, depend on to maintain profitability.</p>



<p>Green Century secured an agreement with Timken in 2021 that led to the company adopting its targets to cut climate emissions from its direct operations by <a href="https://investors.timken.com/financial-news/press-release/2023/Timken-Releases-Annual-CSR-Report-Provides-Update-on-2030-Emissions-Intensity-Target-Progress/default.aspx#:~:text=Announced%20in%202022%20and%20measured,than%20it%20did%20in%202018." target="_blank" rel="noopener">50% by 2030</a>. Despite making significant progress toward that goal, Timken hasn’t updated those targets to encompass its full value chain, which <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represents the vast majority of its emissions</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Timken plays a critical role in the transition to renewable energy</strong></p>



<p>Timken is a major supplier for industries that are critical to reducing climate emissions. The solar and wind industries contributed more than 9% of its sales revenue in 2023, and its customers include companies such as BMW, Ford, and Mercedes, which <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have committed to major climate action</a>. As these customers seek to increase the sustainability of their supply chains, they will increasingly rely on suppliers reducing their own emissions.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Timken continues to be out of step with its peers and customers by failing to set science-based targets that would address its largest emissions sources, which may expose the company to not only the climate and transition risks of increasing emissions but also the competitive and reputational risks of remaining a laggard.</p>



<p>“Timken could bolster its image and position in the industry by committing to science-based climate targets across its full value chain,”<strong> said Green Century shareholder advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/">Giovanna Eichner</a>. </strong>“Passing up the opportunity to become a leader in the renewable energy transition may heighten risks for Timken’s business and investors.”</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">IBM has demonstrated decades-long leadership on climate issues. As early as 1994, it began to disclose its carbon dioxide emissions.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, the company’s recent actions undermine its credibility.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Green Century then filed a shareholder proposal asking Corning to address its climate risk by adopting emissions reduction targets. The company met with Green Century several times and made a commitment to set a science-based target by 2023, which it has now fulfilled.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Established in 1851 as Corning Glass, the company’s products are linked to American history. For example, Corning produced the very first electric light bulbs for Thomas Edison in the 1880s, and in 1915 sold its first line of glass products that could be used for baking and storage under the brand name, Pyrex. More recently, Corning has delivered millions of miles of fiber optic cables to support widespread broadband access. Corning also developed a durable glass, known as Gorilla Glass, for Apple’s first iPhones, a product that is currently used in more than 8 billion devices worldwide, including smart phones, tablets, and laptops.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2023, Green Century followed up with Corning and asked the company to develop and publish a climate transition plan. Now considered a best practice, the plans serve as roadmaps that contain investor-useful information by explaining how and when companies will meet their climate goals.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In early 2023, the General Secretary of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, urged business leaders at the World Economic Forum, to “put forward credible and transparent transition plans on how to achieve net-zero – and submit those plans before the end of this year.&#8221;  More than 4,100 organizations have disclosed to CDP (a reporting platform formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) that they have prepared climate transition plans; however, CDP reports that only 45% were public, and only 12.6% covered what are considered key elements of a credible transition plan. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Now that more and more companies have committed to significantly cut their emissions, investors and stakeholders want assurance that goals and targets aren’t just greenwashing,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “We’re eager to see Corning develop a credible climate transition plan provides milestones, indicators for success, mechanisms for board and executive oversight, and enough details to instill investor confidence.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><strong>BOSTON, June 28, 2023 </strong>– After discussions with Green Century°, The New York Times Company (The Times) set a net-zero by 2030 greenhouse gas emissions target covering its scope 1 and 2 emissions. Green Century had approached the newspaper with concerns about the company’s lack of goals for cutting emissions associated with global warming.</p>
<p>For decades, The Times’ reporters have written extensively about the impacts of climate change. In 2020, the company started hosting an event series called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/netting-zero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netting Zero</a>,” featuring discussions by journalists and climate experts on how to have net-zero emissions in the future. However, at that time, The Times had not set or disclosed its own goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>“This new commitment by The Times is news that’s fit to print &#8212; and just in time,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just issued a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1134777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">synthesis report</a> calling for ‘deep, rapid, and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions,’ and, in response,  U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, urged immediate action to reduce emissions, saying, ‘the <a href="https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm21730.doc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate time-bomb is ticking</a>.’”</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/the-new-york-times-company-announces-pledge-for-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement,</a> The Times noted that it had begun to inventory its scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and that it would publish its results sometime in 2023. Additionally, The Times said it intends to use its building spaces more efficiently, consume resources responsibly and cut greenhouse gas emissions. It also intends to electrify its delivery fleet, update its New York City headquarters to be more sustainable by cutting waste, and source paper from responsibly managed natural resources.</p>
<p>“Committing to reduce its carbon footprint and overall environmental impact is a first step toward putting The New York Times in line with its global peers, including <a href="https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2021/08/25/Positive_Impact_Sustainability_Report_1920.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a>, <a href="https://newscorp.com/news-corp-sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, and <a href="https://aboutus.ft.com/company/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Financial Times</a>,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “Given The Times’ international prominence and the intense public scrutiny it receives, we believe that by implementing rigorous policies, targets and programs to reduce the company’s climate risk, it will help avoid reputational risk.”</p>
<p>The other media outlets mentioned above have set or committed to set near-term science-based targets for their scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions with the Science Based Targets initiative that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In addition, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have committed to reduce at least a portion of their scope 3 emissions by 2030.</p>
