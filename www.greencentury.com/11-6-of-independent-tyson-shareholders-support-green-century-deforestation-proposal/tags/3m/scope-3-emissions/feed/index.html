<p><strong>Boston, May 16, 2025</strong> – Chubb’s* investors voted Thursday on a Green Century° shareholder proposal calling for the company to disclose the climate emissions associated with its investing, underwriting and insuring activities. 13.9% of shareholders cast their votes in favor of the proposal. Chubb is one of the<a href="https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/companies/chubb/67002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> largest publicly traded property and casualty insurers</a>, operating in 55 countries across the globe.</p>



<p>“Investors deserve to know how Chubb’s emissions are driving the climate risks disrupting its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “It’s absurd for Chubb to underwrite activities that cause climate change and then turn around and pay for the claims and payouts caused by these activities.”</p>



<p><a></a>As climate change intensifies, <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2025/01/09/807524.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">insurers are increasingly on the hook</a> after more frequent and severe natural disasters. At the same time, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/newsletter/2025-01-31/insurance-companies-fossil-fuel-industry-eaton-palisades-fire-essential-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many continue to insure fossil fuel projects</a> that exacerbate the losses from those events. Many major insurance companies such as <a href="https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz_com/sustainability/documents/Allianz_Group_Sustainability_Report_2023-web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allianz</a> and <a href="https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:52d75760-2c43-4d96-be2f-0514382ac51a/2023-sustainability-report-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Re</a>* have begun disclosing the emissions associated with their fossil fuel clients, increasing transparency on their role in intensifying the climate crisis.</p>



<p><strong>Chubb insures climate risks</strong></p>



<p>Last year’s wildfires in Los Angeles and destructive hurricane season in the Atlantic have sparked concern about a climate-driven insurance crisis. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 had the most billion-dollar climate-related disasters</a> in one year. Insurance companies are increasingly unable to withstand growing losses without raising prices or reducing coverage in high-risk areas.</p>



<p>Chubb has noticed the impact of climate change on its bottom line. Following an estimated <a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/chubb-estimates-1-5bn-loss-from-la-wildfires-amid-reduced-california-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 billion dollars in losses</a> from the 2024 California fires, Chubb’s Chief Executive Evan Greenberg warned: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pricier-insurance-makes-sense-as-climate-risk-grows-chubb-ceo-says-5e5d53b2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The cost of climate change, to state the obvious: Going up.”</a></p>



<p>“The companies that are supposed to protect us from the consequences of climate change are also fueling its disastrous effects,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Chubb reporting the emissions from its underwriting, investing, and insuring would demonstrate accountability and an intent to reduce its climate impact.”</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 15, 2025</strong> – On May 21, Amazon shareholders will vote on a proposal asking Amazon to disclose the total climate emissions associated with its retail sales. This is the second year Green Century<em>°</em> and shareholder representative <a href="https://www.asyousow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>As You Sow</em></a> are requesting that Amazon more comprehensively measure the greenhouse gas footprint of the products that contribute to its retail sales.</p>



<p>“Amazon’s status as a dominant global retailer means its products have a massive climate impact,”<strong> said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “Failing to report full product emissions is failing to disclose significant climate risk to investors.”</p>



<p><strong>Amazon’s climate footprint exceeds its reporting efforts</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The retail sector is responsible for <a href="https://normative.io/insight/reduce-retailer-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">25% </a>of global greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the largest U.S. retailers, including <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/content/dam/corporate/documents/esgreport/our-esg-priorities/2023%20CDP%20Climate%20Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://mobilecontent.costco.com/staging/resource/img/25w03130/5a_ClimateActionPlan_FY24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Costco</a>* and <a href="https://corporate.target.com/getmedia/c70c48ab-0e10-4576-9e92-789e30665964/2023-CDP-Climate-Response.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Target</a>,* already measure and report emissions from the majority of their products.</p>



<p>Amazon only discloses <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/private-report-shows-how-amazon-drastically-undercounts-its-carbon-footprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the emissions related to its Amazon-branded products</a>, which comprise <a href="https://www.momentumcommerce.com/amazons-private-label-market-share-shrinks-by-6-year-over-year-in-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 1% of its total sales</a>.&nbsp;This excludes a significant amount of Amazon’s products—and their climate impact.</p>



<p>“Despite Amazon being an <a href="https://nrf.com/research-insights/top-retailers/top-50-global-retailers/top-50-global-retailers-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international leader in retail sales</a>, the company lags in emissions reporting,” said<strong> Parker Caswell, </strong><strong>climate and energy senior associate at As You Sow</strong>. “This limited reporting makes Amazon’s emissions appear much smaller than they actually are.”</p>



<p>“Amazon’s lack of transparency about its climate pollution leaves investors in the dark about the company’s exposure to climate risk,” <strong>said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Information on risk is a foundation of disclosures and something every shareholder and potential shareholder deserves: The climate-related risks of Amazon’s total greenhouse gas emissions are no exception.”</p>

<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-482-0800</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 16, 2023</strong> –  <a href="https://www.bldr.com/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Builders FirstSource</a>, the country’s largest building product supplier to the professional market, released the vote result from its annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday. Green Century° received a notable 21% of the vote in favor of its shareholder proposal, which asks the company to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. The proposal additionally asks the company to set goals for sourcing more renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency in its operations, and procuring zero-emission vehicles.</p>
<p>To implement science-based targets, the company would have to reduce its direct, operational emissions and its indirect emissions including from timber harvested for the lumber it sells. Over <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5000 companies</a>, including competitors <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/stories/fresh-thinking/lowes-science-based-net-zero-target-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/sustainability/home-depot-reduced-carbon-emissions-more-127000-metric-tons-2020-commits-100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, have committed to working with the Science Based Targets initiative, and nearly <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fortune-500-companies-are-acting-on-the-climate-crisis-but-is-it-enough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of all Fortune 500 companies have set some kind of climate change reduction target.</p>
<p>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a> said:</p>
<p>“Last year, we filed a nearly identical proposal at Builders asking for reduction targets which received a resounding ‘yes&#8217; vote from investors &#8211; but Builders took almost no action. The company <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001316835/579d09c7-0f03-4884-baa0-f9a54cd7af4e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relies heavily on timber</a>, which comes from forests that are significantly threatened by climate change. We believe management needs to start taking this risk seriously by measuring, disclosing, and setting reduction targets for its Scope 3 supply chain emissions.”</p>
<h4>Green Century Engaged with Builders FirstSource to Set First Emissions Reduction Targets</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century added:</p>
<p>“At the 11th hour, Builders disclosed its <a href="https://s202.q4cdn.com/867695273/files/doc_downloads/esg/Builders-FirstSource_2023-CSR-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scope 1 and 2 emissions</a>, which cover the direct emissions from its operations, and stated it will set emissions reduction targets for both these categories in 2025. While we appreciate that Builders is now taking action on a part of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-at-builders-firstsource-annual-meeting-green-century-wins-majority-vote-on-climate-change-proposal/">Green Century’s 2022 proposal</a>, the company has not yet measured, disclosed, or set targets for its Scope 3, or supply chain emissions, leaving investors in the dark for what comprises, on average, 75% of companies’ climate <a href="https://www.wri.org/update/trends-show-companies-are-ready-scope-3-reporting-us-climate-disclosure-rule#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%20account%20for%2075%25%20of%20companies,greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20on%20average" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions</a>.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>

<p><strong>Boston, April 20, 2023</strong> &#8212; On April 10th, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) upheld Amazon.com Inc.’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gccmamazon040723-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request </a>to block a Green Century° and Amalgamated Bank shareholder proposal from its 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal seeks full disclosure of Amazon&#8217;s scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, which includes emissions associated with the production and use of third-party products and transportation, waste generation, and business travel. Amazon currently publishes only a portion of its scope 3 emissions.</p>
<p>Amazon competitors Walmart and Target quantify, estimate where needed, and disclose all relevant categories of their scope 3 value chain emissions, as defined by the widely-referenced GHG Protocol. In its argument to the SEC, Amazon claimed that Green Century and Amalgamated Bank’s proposal, which asked it to report on its entire emissions footprint according to Protocol guidelines, constituted micromanagement. However, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon failed to emphasize</a> in its letter to the SEC that it currently reports by using the Protocol’s definitions for the scopes 1 &#8211; 3 emissions that it does <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2021-ghg-verification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclose</a>.</p>
<p>Industry experts report that scope 3 emissions often constitute between 70% and 99% of companies’ greenhouse gas emissions footprint, and according to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/09/scope-emissions-climate-greenhouse-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Economic Forum</a>, “Companies will need to cut emissions across all three scopes to meet internationally agreed targets on global warming.” By not accounting for its full greenhouse gas footprint, Amazon may be failing to address all emissions related to running its ecommerce, retail stores, and web services. The company may be in danger of failing to meet its ambitious climate goals.</p>
<p>In reaction to the news, Green Century President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a> expressed disappointment, “Amazon has been a leader on climate by aggressively developing wind projects and supporting the roll out of electric vehicle delivery trucks. It’s troubling that Amazon is blocking shareholders from expressing their opinions on the company’s full exposure to climate risk.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Amazon and the firm, Global Optimism, launched the <a href="https://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Pledge</a>, inviting companies across the globe to “commit to net-zero by 2040 across all emissions scopes.” It is yet unclear the scopes of emissions that Amazon includes in its net-zero by 2040 goal. Walmart and Target report that 97% and  95% of their emissions come from scope 3 sources. According to Amazon, its scope 3 emissions represent only 78% of its total emissions &#8211; that is, only for the scope 3 emissions it actually publishes.</p>
<p>“How are we supposed to assess Amazon’s full climate risk if it’s holding back material information from investors and stakeholders?” questioned Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “Amazon is undermining other companies’ good faith efforts to disclose upstream, downstream, and operational emissions. As the UN Secretary just quipped, &#8216;Our world needs climate action on all fronts: everything, everywhere, all at once.’ Disclosure and action are key to reaching the world’s climate goals.”</p>
