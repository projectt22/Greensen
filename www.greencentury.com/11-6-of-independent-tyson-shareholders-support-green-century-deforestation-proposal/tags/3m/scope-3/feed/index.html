<p><span data-contrast="auto">IBM has demonstrated decades-long leadership on climate issues. As early as 1994, it began to disclose its carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, it first purchased renewable electricity in 2001, publicly supported the Paris Agreement in 2015, and backed a bi-partisan plan for a carbon tax in 2019. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">However, the company’s recent actions undermine its credibility. Even though IBM has a </span><a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/files/reports-policies/2023/IBM_2023_ESG_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">target to substantially reduce its emissions by 2030</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, the target only covers a few categories of its emissions sources. Meanwhile, peers’ targets cover a much wider scope of emissions, including those of Hewlett Packard Enterprise*, Microsoft*, and Salesforce*.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I can’t think of another company that has more to gain by establishing science-based targets and implementing them,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “You simply can’t maintain your leadership position in the industry, while ducking a commitment yourself. The reputational risk is breathtaking.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p>Andrew Shalit, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:ashalit@greencentury.com">ashalit@greencentury.com</a>, 617-747-4439</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, April 25, 2024 </strong>– National retailers Walmart and Tractor Supply Company will not allow shareholders to vote on proposals to disclose more information about the sources of each company’s planet-warming emissions. The move comes after the SEC notified the companies that they could exclude the shareholder proposals filed by Green Century Capital Management from their annual meeting agenda.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed that Walmart and Tractor Supply have decided not to allow shareholders to weigh in on whether the companies should reveal more about their products’ carbon emissions,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century. “These companies sell both highly polluting products and cleaner alternatives. Investors deserve to know how these stores are managing their product portfolios as we transition to a low-carbon economy.”</p>
<p>If implemented, Green Century’s proposals would have provided important insight into the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the products sold at the stores, such as gasoline powered lawn mowers and leaf blowers.</p>
<p><strong>Most Emissions Come from Products, Not Stores</strong></p>
<p>Pollution from the production and use of retail products is a major contributor to <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/formatted_responses/responses?campaign_id=79520704&amp;discloser_id=988600&amp;locale=en&amp;organization_name=Walmart%2C+Inc.&amp;organization_number=20402&amp;program=Investor&amp;project_year=2022&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcdp.credit360.com%2Fsurveys%2F2022%2F6wz4wms4%2F186745&amp;survey_id=78646008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart </a>and <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/539497486/files/doc_financials/2022/sr/7-12-23-TSCO23-ESG-Tear-Sheet-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tractor Supply’s </a>overall carbon footprint. And while both companies provide a breakdown of their emissions from operations, they do not disclose which product categories are responsible for the emissions caused by the products that they sell. Product emissions are many times greater than operational emissions.</p>

<p>“Walmart and Tractor Supply have an opportunity to shed light on the climate pollution from their products,” said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “We hope the companies will follow the example set by Lowe’s and provide this additional information.”</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/lowes-to-increase-disclosure-of-climate-emissions-data/">Lowe’s agreed to provide this expanded disclosure </a>in response to outreach and discussion with Green Century.</p>

<p>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495;</p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p><strong>Boston, March 6, 2024</strong> &#8211; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently finalized its long-awaited <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/33-11275.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate-Related Disclosure rule</a>.</span> Originally proposed two years ago, the rule was crafted in response to investor demand for <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/12/20/why-we-still-need-the-secs-climate-related-disclosures-rule/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20SEC%2C%20the,companies%20in%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent and comprehensive information</a> about climate-related risks and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledgment</a> by federal regulators of such risks to the financial system.</p>
<p>“It’s a step forward, but we feel it&#8217;s too little too late. We wish the SEC had held fast with their proposal to have companies report Scope 3, or indirect, emissions because investors need this data to make informed decisions about how companies are addressing their climate-related risks,” said Green Century Funds° President Leslie Samuelrich. “Companies’ indirect emissions often represent the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%2C%20also%20referred,organizations%20(see%20Figure%201)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority</a> of their total emissions. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/23/sec-expected-to-scale-back-landmark-climate-disclosure-rule-00143046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vigorous opposition</a> by trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation, has restricted investors’ access to vital information.”</p>
<p>The initial draft rule was <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/sec-tees-up-vote-next-week-on-climate-disclosure-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered a victory</a> for investors and <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/news-release-sec-unveils-climate-disclosure-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public interest organizations</a> who were concerned about companies not fully disclosing or downplaying their climate risks. They argued investors could be unknowingly investing billions of dollars in businesses that were not adequately addressing their financial risks.</p>
<p>“Institutional investors have been seeking this information and every day investors would potentially benefit from knowing how the companies in their 401(k), IRAs and other investments are addressing climate risk,” said Samuelrich.</p>
<p>But some business groups opposed the parts of the regulations that require large companies to disclose climate-threatening emissions caused by suppliers and customers and have threatened legal action. However, not including these indirect emissions may result in litigation too. Several nonprofits, including Earthjustice, a leading public interest environmental law nonprofit, indicate they may mount a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-sec-vote-long-awaited-climate-disclosure-rule-notice-says-2024-02-28/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court challenge</a> if major aspects such as indirect carbon emissions, are dropped from the new ruling.</p>
<h3><strong>Regulatory and investor pressure continues  </strong></h3>
<p>Meanwhile, regulatory and investor pressure continues. The new <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Corporate Climate Accountability Act</a> and the European Union’s <a href="https://dart.deloitte.com/USDART/home/publications/deloitte/heads-up/2023/csrd-corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive,</a> will require larger companies to begin reporting their Scope 3 emissions in 2027 and 2025, respectively.</p>
<p>And while mandatory reporting is preferred, many companies already willingly report the greenhouse gas emissions from their operations and supply chains. Green Century recently has worked with several companies, including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-green-century-shareholder-proposal-prompts-costco-commitment-to-set-new-climate-emissions-reduction-targets/">Costco,</a> * <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kroger-to-set-science-based-emissions-reduction-targets-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">Kroger</a>, * and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/corning-sets-ambitious-target-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-embraces-development-of-climate-transition-plan/">Corning</a>* and convinced them to report on their carbon emissions, including Scope 3 emissions.</p>
<p>“Smart companies have recognized climate change as a material risk and already are taking steps to address it. As we say, what gets measured gets managed, and isn’t every investor looking for a well-managed company?” said Samuelrich.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, some important aspects of the rule remain in place.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">The SEC will require companies to explain how severe weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, drought and other natural catastrophes impact their strategies, operations, and financial positions when costs to address such events exceed a certain monetary threshold.</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> The rule will also create a framework to improve the consistency of quantifying Scope 1 and 2 emissions data and will phase in a requirement for third-party verification depending on the size of the company.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This spring I attended a shareholder meeting at Builders FirstSource* in Dallas that was so empty, at first, I thought I was in the wrong place.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a result of Green Century’s engagement, for the first time Builders FirstSource measured and disclosed its CO2 emissions from its operations and transportation and stated it would set emissions reduction targets.
