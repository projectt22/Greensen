					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Pam Podger, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495;</p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p><strong>Boston, March 6, 2024</strong> &#8211; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently finalized its long-awaited <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/33-11275.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate-Related Disclosure rule</a>.</span> Originally proposed two years ago, the rule was crafted in response to investor demand for <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/12/20/why-we-still-need-the-secs-climate-related-disclosures-rule/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20SEC%2C%20the,companies%20in%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent and comprehensive information</a> about climate-related risks and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledgment</a> by federal regulators of such risks to the financial system.</p>
<p>“It’s a step forward, but we feel it&#8217;s too little too late. We wish the SEC had held fast with their proposal to have companies report Scope 3, or indirect, emissions because investors need this data to make informed decisions about how companies are addressing their climate-related risks,” said Green Century Funds° President Leslie Samuelrich. “Companies’ indirect emissions often represent the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%2C%20also%20referred,organizations%20(see%20Figure%201)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority</a> of their total emissions. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/23/sec-expected-to-scale-back-landmark-climate-disclosure-rule-00143046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vigorous opposition</a> by trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation, has restricted investors’ access to vital information.”</p>
<p>The initial draft rule was <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/sec-tees-up-vote-next-week-on-climate-disclosure-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considered a victory</a> for investors and <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/news-release-sec-unveils-climate-disclosure-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public interest organizations</a> who were concerned about companies not fully disclosing or downplaying their climate risks. They argued investors could be unknowingly investing billions of dollars in businesses that were not adequately addressing their financial risks.</p>
<p>“Institutional investors have been seeking this information and every day investors would potentially benefit from knowing how the companies in their 401(k), IRAs and other investments are addressing climate risk,” said Samuelrich.</p>
<p>But some business groups opposed the parts of the regulations that require large companies to disclose climate-threatening emissions caused by suppliers and customers and have threatened legal action. However, not including these indirect emissions may result in litigation too. Several nonprofits, including Earthjustice, a leading public interest environmental law nonprofit, indicate they may mount a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-sec-vote-long-awaited-climate-disclosure-rule-notice-says-2024-02-28/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court challenge</a> if major aspects such as indirect carbon emissions, are dropped from the new ruling.</p>
<h3><strong>Regulatory and investor pressure continues  </strong></h3>
<p>Meanwhile, regulatory and investor pressure continues. The new <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California Corporate Climate Accountability Act</a> and the European Union’s <a href="https://dart.deloitte.com/USDART/home/publications/deloitte/heads-up/2023/csrd-corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive,</a> will require larger companies to begin reporting their Scope 3 emissions in 2027 and 2025, respectively.</p>
<p>And while mandatory reporting is preferred, many companies already willingly report the greenhouse gas emissions from their operations and supply chains. Green Century recently has worked with several companies, including <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/release-green-century-shareholder-proposal-prompts-costco-commitment-to-set-new-climate-emissions-reduction-targets/">Costco,</a> * <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/kroger-to-set-science-based-emissions-reduction-targets-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">Kroger</a>, * and <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/corning-sets-ambitious-target-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-embraces-development-of-climate-transition-plan/">Corning</a>* and convinced them to report on their carbon emissions, including Scope 3 emissions.</p>
<p>“Smart companies have recognized climate change as a material risk and already are taking steps to address it. As we say, what gets measured gets managed, and isn’t every investor looking for a well-managed company?” said Samuelrich.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">Nevertheless, some important aspects of the rule remain in place.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">The SEC will require companies to explain how severe weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, drought and other natural catastrophes impact their strategies, operations, and financial positions when costs to address such events exceed a certain monetary threshold.</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> The rule will also create a framework to improve the consistency of quantifying Scope 1 and 2 emissions data and will phase in a requirement for third-party verification depending on the size of the company.</span></p>

					<h3>SEC blocks Green Century<em>°</em> shareholder proposal on Right to Repair at Deere &amp; Company*</h3>
<p><strong>Contact Information: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, </strong><a href="mailto:dguernsey@greencentury.com"><strong>dguernsey@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, </strong><a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com"><strong>ppodger@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p>(<strong>Boston, MA</strong>) Shareholders will not get to vote on Deere &amp; Company’s opposition to Right to Repair at the company’s Annual General Meeting this year after the SEC granted Deere’s no action request.</p>
<p>This is the second time shareholders of the tractor company have been denied a vote on a Green Century proposal because of an SEC no-action request.</p>
<p>“It is disappointing that Deere doesn’t want to allow shareholders to vote on this issue,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “Allowing farmers the right to repair their own equipment is common sense, and Deere’s opposition presents reputational risks to the brand. In the end, this may hurt investors.”</p>
<p>Green Century submitted a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/deere-co-faces-shareholder-scrutiny-on-right-to-repair-stand/">shareholder proposal</a> asking Deere to issue a public report on the benefits and drawbacks of opposing Right to Repair regulation and the financial and reputational risk associated with opposition in Q4 of 2023.</p>
<p>Deere’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcefdeere122923-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposition</a> was based on the argument that Green Century’s shareholder proposal would directly and negatively impact the Company’s ongoing “litigation strategy”.</p>
<p>Deere is currently the subject of a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1274486/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">class action lawsuit</a> from farmers who allege that Deere and its authorized dealerships have “attempted monopolization, exclusionary conduct and restraint in the repair service market for John Deere brand agricultural equipment.”</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Pressure and Broad Bipartisan Support Continues to Grow for Right to Repair</strong></p>
<p>Bipartisan Right to Repair legislation, like that passed in Colorado which allows <a href="https://apnews.com/article/colorado-right-to-repair-farming-equipment-1da00ea957fd1057bf522cb4725e62d4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">farmers</a> and <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb22-1031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wheelchair</a> users access to fix their own equipment, has been gaining momentum in the United States and in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/congress-takes-on-right-to-repair-consumer-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiple bills</a> have been introduced in Congress that would give consumers broader access to repair.</p>
<p>President Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/24/remarks-by-president-biden-before-meeting-with-the-white-house-competition-council/#:~:text=Too%20many%20areas%2C%20if%20you,It&#039;s%20broke." target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicated supporting consumer’s right to repair</a>, stating that too often “if you own a product, from a smartphone to a tractor, you don’t have the freedom to choose how or where the repair that item you purchased.”</p>
<p>In addition to reducing costs and downtime, access to repair helps spur competition.</p>
<p>Deere has opposed allowing independent repair shops and farmers to fix equipment sold by Deere, citing emissions control concerns. The <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/the-epa-finally-refutes-john-deere-dealership-arguments-against-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPA</a> has rejected these concerns, and advocates point out that if farmers are limited in their repair options, they face increased costs and may miss critical harvesting deadlines.</p>
<p>Last November, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/deere-must-face-us-farmers-right-to-repair-lawsuits-judge-rules-2023-11-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. District Judge</a> in Illinois stated that Deere must face claims that it had conspired to restrict repairs.</p>
<p>“Green Century will continue to advocate for the right to repair,” said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate working on the issue. “Access to repair not only benefits consumers and the economy, but it is a critical environmental issue. Extending the lifespan of our equipment is one of the largest environmental contributions someone can make as an individual.”</p>

<p><strong>Media Contact:</strong> Thomas Peterson, tpeterson@greencentury.com, 781-349-2615; Annalisa Tarizzo, atarizzo@greencentury.com, 781-349-2789</p>



<p><strong>Boston, March 21, 2022</strong> – The Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed new rules</a> today that would require publicly traded companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the risks that climate change poses to their businesses, their governance of these risks, and their emissions reduction targets if relevant. The proposal requires disclosure of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which constitute emissions from a company’s operations and purchased energy, and, for some companies, Scope 3 emissions, or emissions associated with a company’s supply chain and the use of its products. The proposed rules will be subject to a public comment period before they are finalized.</p>



<p><strong>Green Century° president Leslie Samuelrich issued the following statement:</strong></p>



<p>“The SEC’s proposed requirement that companies disclose their greenhouse gas emissions represents a major step forward. We believe climate vulnerabilities and value chain emissions constitute material information, and investors need reliable, comparable disclosures in order to assess issuers’ exposure to physical and transition risk. These SEC rules will ensure companies provide that critical disclosure.</p>



<p>“We applaud the SEC for including a phased-in requirement that large companies disclose scope 3 emissions when these emissions are material or when the company has scope 3 emissions targets. Scope 3 emissions represent the vast majority of the climate impact of companies in many sectors, from fossil fuels, to retail, to consumer packaged goods. Investors need these disclosures in order to understand a company’s true exposure to climate risk, and to evaluate whether companies are authentically reducing the emissions associated with their value chains. As our shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-disclosure-poses-thorny-questions-for-sec-as-rules-weighed-11645180200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Wall Street Journal last month</a>, the exclusion of scope 3 emissions disclosure would have incentivized companies to shift emissions to their suppliers or customers to give the impression of emissions reduction, while value chain emissions actually grew or remained static. Some of the world’s largest polluters have vastly underreported and misrepresented their emissions by excluding scope 3. The SEC is closing the door on that kind of greenwashing.”</p>
