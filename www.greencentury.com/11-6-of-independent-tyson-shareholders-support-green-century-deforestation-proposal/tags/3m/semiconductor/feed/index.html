<p><strong>Boston, May 23, 2025 </strong>– 10.5% of McDonald’s* shareholders cast their votes in favor of a Green Century° shareholder proposal asking the company to assess whether its existing climate policies and plans are sufficient to achieve its emissions reduction targets. The resolution, which went to the ballot Tuesday, requests details on McDonald’s progress toward reaching its net-zero emissions by 2050 goal</p>



<p>“McDonald’s commitment to reducing carbon pollution shows that the company understands the risks that a warming planet poses to its business,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Now, McDonald’s must assure investors that it will live up to its commitments and take the necessary steps to meaningfully reduce climate-related risks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Beef has an outsized climate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/food-systems-responsible-for-one-third-of-human-caused-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our food system</a> accounts for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and few meals we eat contribute to those emissions more than a burger. The life cycle of beef from farm to fork<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emits more greenhouse gas emissions</a> per kilogram than any other food, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular fast-food restaurants can play a key role in addressing climate change by buying and selling beef produced with processes that reduce emissions. Chains including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/technology/burger-king-impossible-whopper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burger King,</a> <a href="https://smashburger.com/menu/smashburgers/veggie-smash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smashburger</a> and <a href="https://shakeshack.com/blog/our-food/introducing-our-veggie-shack-non-dairy-chocolate-shake-and-non-dairy-frozen-custard#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shake Shack</a> have added alternative-protein patties to their menus. Diversifying protein options to encourage consumers to reduce their consumption of beef is one <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical method to cutting climate emissions</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>McDonald’s </strong><strong>is slow </strong><strong>to show progress&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s set short- and long-term targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in line with what science says is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Because beef makes up about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/the-carbon-footprint-of-mcdonald-s-menu-very-big" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-third of the company&#8217;s total climate footprint</a>, reducing beef-related emissions is an impactful strategy to achieve its climate goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the climate risks of increasing emissions, McDonald’s is exposing itself to reputational risk by failing to illustrate it is on track to meet its climate commitments. <a href="https://www.esgdive.com/news/greenwashing-rising-report-rep-risk-social-washing-sustainability/696289/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Environmental groups </a>have suggested companies, <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/mcdonalds-greenwashing-2655223811.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including McDonald’s</a>, may be misleading customers about the extent of their climate action, a phenomenon called “greenwashing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>McDonald’s has several initiatives to decrease the emissions from beef production. These plans aim to<a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/mcdonalds-syngenta-team-up-to-create-a-more-sustainable-hamburger-enogen-lopez/732945/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">produce beef more sustainably</a> and<a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-purpose-and-impact/food-quality-and-sourcing/responsible-sourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve soil’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide</a>. Still, the company <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/franchises/the-mcplant-is-out-but-the-mcrib-will-be-back-heres-when/476654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinued its only plant-based burger</a> in the United States, <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its largest </a><a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/20231202_Investor%20Update%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">market</a> in terms of system-wide sales, signaling alternative proteins may not be a part of its approach to cutting climate emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“McDonald’s lacks alternative protein options that would help it reduce its beef-related emissions and demonstrate progress toward achieving its goals,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>S</strong><strong>hareholder </strong><strong>A</strong><strong>dvocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “The happiest meal for investors is one that shows the company is reducing emissions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, May 16, 2025</strong> – A Green Century° shareholder proposal requesting that Skyworks Solutions* disclose its full contribution to climate change received 21.9% of votes cast at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. The semiconductor manufacturer supplies major technology companies including Apple* , Google* and Microsoft* with materials that power billions of electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops.</p>



<p>“Investors need a more complete understanding of a business’ contribution and exposure to climate risk to understand potential effects on their investments,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“By disclosing the majority of its emissions, Skyworks would catch up to industry standards and meet investor expectations.”</p>



<p><strong>Skyworks lags competitors and customers on climate ambition</strong></p>



<p>The semiconductor industry accounted for <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much climate pollution as half of U.S. households</a><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> combined</a><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2023</a>. About <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/a-plan-to-reduce-semiconductor-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% of a semiconductor’s climate footprint</a> comes from across its supply chain, including raw materials and device use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of Skyworks’ peers are reducing their impact on climate change. NXP Semiconductors* and Applied Materials* are among more than <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10,000 companies</a> that have set science-based climate emissions reduction targets. In addition, more than 60 semiconductor companies founded the <a href="https://www.semi.org/en/industry-groups/semiconductor-climate-consortium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semiconductor Climate Consortium</a> to mitigate emissions from the industry.</p>



<p>Skyworks’ largest customers also surpass the company in their climate commitments. Apple, which <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405602-skyworks-solutions-downgraded-at-argus-on-apple-worries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accounted for 69% of Skyworks’ net revenue</a> in 2024, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aims to be carbon neutral by 2030</a>, and other customers such as <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/climate-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> have equally ambitious targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Disclosing climate emissions increases transparency and drives action</strong></p>



<p>Measuring full value-chain emissions helps companies identify the largest sources of greenhouse gases across their operations and supply chain. It is also a crucial first step toward setting targets and implementing actions to reduce emissions.</p>



<p>Although Skyworks has disclosed its operational emissions and emissions from business travel, these are <a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely</a><a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> to account for less than 10%</a><a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a>of the company’s overall impact on climate change based on competitors’ disclosures. <a href="https://www.appliedmaterials.com/eu/en/corporate-responsibility/planet/net-zero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peers that report a more complete emissions inventory</a> show that supply-chain and device use emissions typically comprise more than 90% of a semiconductor’s climate impact.</p>



<p>“Skyworks disclosing its full value-chain emissions would signal its intent to catch up to competitors and meet its customers’ expectations for climate action,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Continuing to trail the industry creates reputational, competitive, and climate risks that threaten its bottom line and the planet.”</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Applied has taken significant steps to lessen its impact on the planet. By 2030, the company aims to reduce its operational emissions by 50% and a portion of emissions from use of its sophisticated manufacturing equipment. In addition, it plans to install the largest rooftop solar array in the state of Texas on its Austin-based logistics service center and to reach 100% renewable electricity globally by 2030.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Applied is tackling its climate impact on many fronts, and we’re really pleased that it’s so proactive,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “In the future, we hope  Applied is transparent about its plan to achieve its ambitious goals. In other words, tell investors how you will position your company and products for a low-carbon world.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">“I was really pleased that Applied could see that, while good, its Net-Zero by 2040 plan could be even more helpful to investors if it included elements of a climate transition plan, that is, more insight into its thinking about short- and medium-term actions in its own operations and with customers and suppliers,” commented Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Applied responded well to Green Century’s concerns, and I think our agreement cements its leadership role in the manufacturing space.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, </span><a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aranger@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 781-349-2813;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, </span><a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ppodger@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>BOSTON, April 26, 2023 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– After filing shareholder proposals with each company, Green Century° successfully secured commitments with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.,* Intel Corporation,* NVIDIA Corporation,*  ON Semiconductor Corporation,* and Texas Instruments, Inc.* requesting they publish climate transition plans. Climate transition plans detail companies&#8217; near- and medium-term strategies and future actions deemed necessary to reaching their greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations describes such plans as an “</span><a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/high-level_expert_group_n7b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essential tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” for building public trust, helping companies align “governance and incentive structures, capital expenditures, research and development, skills and human resource development, and public advocacy…” with their targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressure to plan for and achieve steep emissions cuts comes not only from investors, but from the semiconductor industry itself. The Semiconductor Climate Consortium, which is an initiative of  the microelectronics industry group SEMI, urges its members to set net-zero emissions targets and to transparently report progress. Additionally, semiconductor company customers that have net-zero emissions reduction targets, such as Apple,* Google,* and Microsoft,* are increasingly eyeing their chip suppliers as they look to eliminate their upstream emissions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Climate Transition Plans Help Investors Assess Companies’ Progress In Limiting Climate Change</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe each company recognizes the value of producing climate transition plans for investors and that their leadership will encourage peers and competitors to do the same,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Investors increasingly need visibility into companies’ assumptions, opportunities, barriers, and emissions reduction pathways as they move toward fulfilling their emissions reduction targets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semiconductor chip manufacturing is energy intensive and relies heavily on electricity to power furnaces, manufacturing equipment, and to maintain clean rooms. As a result, companies like Intel, NVIDIA, and ON Semiconductor are looking to source 100% renewable energy for their operations.  However, semiconductor manufacturing also uses gases that are essential  to completing chip designs, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs). PFCs have a global warming potential that is thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide, and the gases are currently much more difficult to replace with less potent alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The semiconductor industry has some very real challenges to overcome in order to secure a path to net-zero emissions,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger, “The idea of climate transition plans is relatively new, but for Green Century, they couldn’t come quickly enough. The window of time for limiting devastating climate impacts is so narrow; we need to know that companies are planning and doing their part to ensure a livable future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranger added, “I want to acknowledge Advanced Micro Devices and ON Semiconductor, especially, for agreeing to create the most comprehensive transition plans I’ve seen yet. All five companies, however, deserve praise for their new commitments.” </span></p>
