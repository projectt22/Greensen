					<h3>Green Century Pushed Microsoft to Extend Security Support to Prevent E-Waste</h3>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> &#8211; After engagement with <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century</a>°, Microsoft Corporation* announced it would extend Windows 10 security updates (ESU) for organizations of all sizes, including schools, the public sector, and for the first time, individuals. Microsoft will provide security updates options to devices using Windows 10 past their End of Support (EOS) date of October 14, 2025.</p>
<p>“Your computer shouldn’t become trash just because it can’t get a security update,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “Microsoft’s move may save vital institutions like hospitals and schools billions of dollars and could prevent millions of functioning computers from becoming toxic e-waste.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_18681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18681" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-18681" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Microsfot-300x158.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="158" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18681" class="wp-caption-text">Green Century Pushed Microsoft to Extend Security Support</figcaption></figure>
<p>An estimated 330-400 million devices may not be able to upgrade from Windows 10 because of hardware requirements. Microsoft planned End of Support (EOS) date could lead users to dispose of Windows devices which are not eligible to upgrade because of security concerns.</p>
<p>Reports brought to light and campaigns by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) have suggested that the End of Support for Windows 10 could cause the single biggest jump in junked computers ever.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s new Extended Security Update (ESU) program will cost a fee, the details of which will be released at a later date. The plan for commercial customers such as schools, the public sector, and small and mid-sized businesses will be available for three years. The consumer plan will be available initially for one year.</p>
<h3>Microsoft’s commitment is a good step forward, but the cost of the program could be a barrier to access and remains an issue.</h3>
<p>Critics are concerned that the undisclosed cost of ESUs may limit access to the ESU plan and thus reduce the program’s positive environmental impact. Experts suggest that 33% of computers using Windows 10 will not be able to update to Windows 11 because of hardware requirements. This could lead users to discard their devices prematurely out of concern for performance issues and exposure to security risks, which in turn will cause otherwise working computers to end up in landfills. E-waste is the fastest growing form of waste, yet only a small percentage of it is recycled.</p>
<p>“Microsoft is clearly thinking about its long-term environmental impact by extending critical security updates beyond the End of Support of Windows 10,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Now the company should make these important updates as widely accessible &#8211; and affordable &#8211; as possible.”</p>
<p>The vast majority of the environmental impact of electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry. According to the World Economic Forum, extending the lifespan of phones from three to four years could reduce the number of phones sent to waste by 25%.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Much of this work happens on the computer or over the phone, but there is nothing like meeting in person &#8211; partially because you never know what to expect.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This spring I attended a shareholder meeting at Builders FirstSource* in Dallas that was so empty, at first, I thought I was in the wrong place. I was waiting completely on my own in a 100-seat event room when suddenly I was joined by a small handful of executives from the company.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With so few of us in the room, th</span><span data-contrast="auto">e CEO, General Counsel and I discussed Green Century’s proposal, which asked the company to commit to reducing carbon emissions associated with timber harvesting and other supply chain issues.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a result of Green Century’s engagement, for the first time Builders FirstSource measured and disclosed its CO2 emissions from its operations and transportation and stated it would set emissions reduction targets. The company still has significant work to do, including measuring its emissions from timber harvesting, setting efficiency targets for its supply chain, and prioritizing sourcing FSC certified lumber. We will continue to work with the company to achieve these goals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Boston, June 16, 2023</strong> –  <a href="https://www.bldr.com/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Builders FirstSource</a>, the country’s largest building product supplier to the professional market, released the vote result from its annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday. Green Century° received a notable 21% of the vote in favor of its shareholder proposal, which asks the company to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. The proposal additionally asks the company to set goals for sourcing more renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency in its operations, and procuring zero-emission vehicles.</p>
<p>To implement science-based targets, the company would have to reduce its direct, operational emissions and its indirect emissions including from timber harvested for the lumber it sells. Over <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5000 companies</a>, including competitors <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/stories/fresh-thinking/lowes-science-based-net-zero-target-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lowe’s</a> and <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/news/sustainability/home-depot-reduced-carbon-emissions-more-127000-metric-tons-2020-commits-100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot</a>, have committed to working with the Science Based Targets initiative, and nearly <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/fortune-500-companies-are-acting-on-the-climate-crisis-but-is-it-enough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60%</a> of all Fortune 500 companies have set some kind of climate change reduction target.</p>
<p>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a> said:</p>
<p>“Last year, we filed a nearly identical proposal at Builders asking for reduction targets which received a resounding ‘yes&#8217; vote from investors &#8211; but Builders took almost no action. The company <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001316835/579d09c7-0f03-4884-baa0-f9a54cd7af4e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relies heavily on timber</a>, which comes from forests that are significantly threatened by climate change. We believe management needs to start taking this risk seriously by measuring, disclosing, and setting reduction targets for its Scope 3 supply chain emissions.”</p>
<h4>Green Century Engaged with Builders FirstSource to Set First Emissions Reduction Targets</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century added:</p>
<p>“At the 11th hour, Builders disclosed its <a href="https://s202.q4cdn.com/867695273/files/doc_downloads/esg/Builders-FirstSource_2023-CSR-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scope 1 and 2 emissions</a>, which cover the direct emissions from its operations, and stated it will set emissions reduction targets for both these categories in 2025. While we appreciate that Builders is now taking action on a part of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-at-builders-firstsource-annual-meeting-green-century-wins-majority-vote-on-climate-change-proposal/">Green Century’s 2022 proposal</a>, the company has not yet measured, disclosed, or set targets for its Scope 3, or supply chain emissions, leaving investors in the dark for what comprises, on average, 75% of companies’ climate <a href="https://www.wri.org/update/trends-show-companies-are-ready-scope-3-reporting-us-climate-disclosure-rule#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%20account%20for%2075%25%20of%20companies,greenhouse%20gas%20emissions%20on%20average" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emissions</a>.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 9<em>,</em> 2023</strong> – Shareholders of the United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) showed lower support for a Green Century° and Trillium Asset Management proposal asking the company to adopt an independently verified science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Votes in favor reached 20%. By comparison, the same proposal filed last year by Green Century, Trillium, and a third investor achieved <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-green-century-reacts-to-vote-at-ups-on-climate-shareholder-proposal/">twenty-eight percent of votes cast in favor</a>.</p>
<p>In 2021, UPS announced a goal to become <a href="https://www.edie.net/ups-aims-to-become-carbon-neutral-by-2050/#:~:text=Logistics%20giant%20UPS%20has%20unveiled,its%20global%20operations%20by%202050." target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon neutral by 2050</a> for emissions related to its direct operations, e.g. related to package delivery and air freight. Its goal also covers UPS’s indirect emissions, i.e. from third parties, such as the emissions from air freight provided by its vendors or emissions associated with manufacturing the goods that UPS uses, like sorting equipment. Nevertheless, Green Century remains concerned the company’s commitment may be an empty promise because its goal has not been verified by an independent third party. Nor is it clear whether UPS’s intent to reduce its direct and indirect emissions will align with limiting its greenhouse gas emissions to 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise. Climate experts strongly recommend that the world not exceed this temperature in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>By contrast, other companies in the transportation sector, such as passenger airlines Delta, American, Air France, Iberia, KLM, and United have all committed to set science-based targets (SBTs) via Science Based Targets initiative, a global standard setting body and verifier of SBTs. For its land transportation needs, UPS has turned to alternative fuels, such as renewable natural gas (RNG). However, some believe that the production and consumption of RNG could steer efforts away from the electrification of delivery fleets. Unlike UPS, its competitors, Fedex and Amazon, have committed to purchasing 50% EV delivery trucks by 2025 and 100% by 2030 and 100,000 EV trucks by 2030, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said: </strong></p>
<p>“We filed the shareholder proposal for a second year in a row because we believe UPS’s sustainability efforts are not delivering for us, and we felt it was important to bring our concerns in front of all shareholders,” Samuelrich said. “Regardless of the vote, it is our opinion that UPS’s plans for emissions reductions need to be science-based and verified by credible third parties.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"> Andrea Ranger</a>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century Funds, added: </strong></p>
<p>“Cutting emissions as swiftly and deeply as possible makes sense especially for transportation and logistics companies.  Climate change is contributing to severe weather that will very likely threaten UPS’ operations and profitability,” Ranger said. “Just last summer,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/20/business/ups-postal-workers-heat-stroke-deaths.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> brutal heat waves sent UPS drivers to the hospital</a> and, tragically, caused several deaths. We would like to see UPS do its utmost to rein in its emissions in order to protect human health and stabilize the climate.”</p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts: Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, </strong><a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com"><strong>aranger@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 781-349-2813; </strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>BOSTON, January 19, 2023 </strong>– In exchange for the withdrawal of a Green Century° shareholder proposal, San Diego-based Jack in the Box restaurants  <a href="https://investors.jackinthebox.com/esg/Housing---Sows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it will switch to 100% “group housed” pork by the end of 2026. In this process, breeding pigs are housed in groups rather than restrictive “gestation” crates for at least a majority of each pregnancy cycle. Green Century pressed Jack in the Box to make this transition after a decade of failed promises to do so. Gestation crates confine pregnant sows in spaces that are roughly 2 feet by 7 feet, areas so small that they can’t even turn around. Nine states ban the practice.</p>
<p>“Jack in the Box made a promise in 2012 to eliminate gestation crate usage from its supply chain by 2022 but it didn’t keep its pledge,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Shareholders want companies to uphold their commitments &#8212; and everyone wants to see animals treated as humanely as possible. Companies who fail to do either or both incur reputational risks. We’re pleased to see Jack in the Box finally taking action on this important animal welfare issue.”</p>
<p>Jack in the Box’s competitors have made progress on sourcing pork from suppliers that have reduced or eliminated gestation crates.  McDonald’s will reach 100% “group housed” pork by 2024 in the United States, as will Burger King and Tim Hortons (in both the U.S. and Canada). Wendy’s, Panera Bread and other quick service chains have already achieved that goal in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Whether you’re a fan of Jack in the Box’s bacon double cheeseburger or just an investor worried that your company is not tuned into animal welfare issues and the oft-correlated competitive and reputational damage, Jack in the Box’s new announcement is welcomed news,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “We appreciate that Jack in the Box quickly established a hard cutoff date to switch to 100% group housed pork. There’s no excuse for putting pregnant pigs in the equivalent of animal jail.”</p>
