<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495<br />
Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA, 2023) &#8211; </strong>Following shareholder engagement by Green Century°, Alphabet* announced that it plans to extend software updates for Chromebooks for up to ten years starting in 2024, and that no existing Chromebooks will expire in the next two years. It is estimated the changes in policy could impact up to 120 million computers currently on the market.</p>
<p>The multiple year extension by the parent company of Google* allows schools and families to keep functioning Chromebooks to remain in use, preventing those items from becoming e-waste.</p>
<p>“This is a major win for the environment, schools, and the shareholder advocacy process,” said Douglass Guernsey, a Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management. “By extending the life of Chromebooks commonly used in schools, Alphabet is getting ahead of addressing potential risks and making sure hardware using its software can be used for as long as possible.”</p>
<h3><strong>Green Century and Consumer Activists Help Consumers and School Districts</strong></h3>
<p>Green Century discuss risks raised by the “<a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/PIRG-Chromebook-Churn-Full-Report-May-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chromebook Churn</a>” published by <a href="https://pirg.org/resources/what-is-right-to-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PIRG</a> (Public Interest Research Groups) directly with Alphabet management in Summer 2023. Chromebook’s “Auto Update Expiration” date would cause millions of Chromebooks to stop working even if the hardware was still functioning. The report showed that extending the life of Chromebooks could result in <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/chromebook-churn-report-highlights-problems-of-short-lived-laptops-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.8 billion dollars</a> in savings for taxpayers and could save millions of tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Green Century has previously engaged Alphabet on improving reparability of its <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-withdraws-right-to-repair-shareholder-proposal-after-google-parent-alphabet-agrees-to-make-pixel-replacement-parts-available/">Pixel phones</a> and disclosing details of the company’s <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/google-parent-alphabet-pledges-greater-transparency-on-use-of-carbon-offsets-after-green-century-shareholder-proposal-2/">carbon offsets</a>. Both previous engagements resulted in changes from management to address environmental concerns.</p>
