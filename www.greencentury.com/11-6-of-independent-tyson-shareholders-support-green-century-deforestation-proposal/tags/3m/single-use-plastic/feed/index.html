										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					<p><strong>Boston &#8211; </strong>Mattel, Inc.*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to report on its single-use plastic in packaging to the standardized reporting framework CDP in 2025 after reaching an agreement with <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century</a>°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>Mattel uses plastic packaging for its popular toy brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, and continues to develop ways to improve the sustainability of its packaging.</p>
<p>“We have tremendous respect for the team at Mattel and applaud the company’s commitment to transparency,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Accurate data is critical for decision making, and this new commitment will let investors look ‘into the box’ to view how Mattel is reducing plastic waste.”</p>
<p>Mattel and Green Century had previously reached a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/">deal</a> in which Mattel agreed to set a company-wide plastic reduction goal. Mattel fulfilled that agreement in 2022 by committing to reduce its plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030.</p>
<p>This additional commitment to disclose information on single-use plastic in packaging to CDP will help stakeholders better understand Mattel’s sustainable packaging efforts through a recognized, standardized reporting platform.</p>
<h3><strong>Mattel to join 3,000 global companies reporting to CDP Plastic</strong></h3>
<p>Standardized reporting is an essential first step in reducing plastic pollution.</p>
<p>“Right now, each company discloses plastic information in different ways, making it nearly impossible for governments, recyclers, and investors to really know what plastic is out there,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We really view CDP as the gold standard when it comes to voluntary disclosure.”</p>
<h3><strong>Plastic pollution continues explosive growth</strong></h3>
<p>The current plastic waste system has failed to keep plastic out of the ecosystem. Only <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/campaigns/beyond-plastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastic waste is recycled</a>, while plastic pollution has doubled every six years.</p>
<p>Plastic waste makes its way into waterways, killing marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, as plastic doesn’t break down like other materials, small particles of “<a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/updates/microplastics-in-100-of-the-co-waterways-we-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics</a>” have been found in every environment and even the human bloodstream.</p>
<p>The issue has increasingly alarmed consumers and investors. Over <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of respondents to a recent survey have asked companies to use less single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Companies’ efforts to improve sustainability of their products and packaging are an important aspect of helping to protect the planet for future generations.</p>

<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, </strong><a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com"><strong>ppodger@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, </strong><a href="mailto:dguernsey@greencentury.com"><strong>dguernsey@greencentury.com</strong></a><strong>, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(March 13, Boston, MA) </strong>Marriott International, Inc*, the world’s largest hospitality company, will set a single-use plastic reduction goal by the end of 2025 and disclose a baseline footprint of single-use plastics starting in 2026, thanks to an agreement with Green Century°.</p>
<p>“We welcome Marriott’s commitment to transparency and to cutting its plastic use,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of the Green Century Funds. “Customers, investors, and business leaders value sustainability, so Marriott is taking the right approach to prepare for the future.”</p>
<p>Regulatory and economic pressures have pushed companies to disclose and reduce the use of non-essential single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Marriott has taken steps toward reducing single-use plastic in its operations, including transitioning away from tiny, single-use toiletry bottles to more-sustainable, larger bottles for bath amenities. The bigger bottles are more recyclable and help reduce plastic waste.</p>
<p>“Given Marriott’s scale, with more than 1.5 million hotel rooms worldwide, small changes make massive impacts,” said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “We are pleased that the company is working to create a more sustainable business and planet.”</p>
<p><strong>Plastic Pollution Continues its Explosive Growth</strong></p>
<p>Plastic pollution entering the oceans has been doubling every six years, killing 1 million marine creatures annually. More than 91% of plastics are not recycled.</p>
<p>Experts agree that reducing non-essential single-use plastic is necessary to address the growing plastic pollution crisis.</p>
<p>While some plastic doesn’t have viable alternatives, many single-use applications do.</p>
<p>“Companies first need to understand the scale of the problem and disclose the risks associated with it,” said Guernsey. “Only with reliable information can investors make cogent decisions to reduce the tidal wave of plastic pollution.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Director of Communications, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, April 17, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Colgate-Palmolive*, a leading global consumer products </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/3456/colgate-palmolive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will enhance its efforts to reduce plastic packaging and scale up reuse models that cut down on single-use plastic. In exchange for this heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Capital Management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal slated for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction of total plastic packaging use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/10/breakingtheplasticwave_mainreport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 million tons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of plastic waste is released into the ocean annually, </span><a href="https://conserveturtles.org/information-sea-turtles-threats-marine-debris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killing more than 1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marine animals each year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Colgate-Palmolive for stepping up its efforts to tackle the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Colgate-Palmolive to accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colgate-Palmolive’s planned actions include more thorough disclosure in future sustainability reports of </span><a href="https://www.colgatepalmolive.com/en-us/who-we-are/stories/plastic-commitments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reuse pilots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company has launched or planned, such as refillable jars for toothpaste tablets and Palmolive dish gel sold in refillable bottles. The company also will publish a “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its upcoming 2023 sustainability report and accelerate 2030 target-setting for plastic reduction that will prioritize packaging redesign and expansion of reuse and refill models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s clear that we can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Colgate-Palmolive significantly reduce its total contribution to plastic waste as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #008000;">States will make producers responsible for the waste they create</span></strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s focus on plastic reduction comes not a moment too soon: a December 2022 survey found that 84% of registered U.S. voters support increasing the use of reusable packaging and foodware, and 80% support requiring companies to reduce their single-use </span><a href="https://usa.oceana.org/press-releases/americans-are-sick-of-single-use-plastic-pollution-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic packaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Governments are also taking note: since 2021, Maine, Oregon, California and Colorado have adopted the nation’s first producer responsibility laws for consumer packaging, which will make producers financially responsible for the packaging waste they create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our environment for centuries,” added Sanders. “Reuse and refill models, which </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2020/07/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rank among the most effective ways to replace single-use plastics, are critical solutions that companies must urgently scale up to meet one of the most profound environmental challenges of our time.” </span></p>
