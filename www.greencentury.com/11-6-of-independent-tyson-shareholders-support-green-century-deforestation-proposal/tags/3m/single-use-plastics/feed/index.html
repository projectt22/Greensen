<p><strong>(March 13, Boston, MA) </strong>Marriott International, Inc*, the world’s largest hospitality company, will set a single-use plastic reduction goal by the end of 2025 and disclose a baseline footprint of single-use plastics starting in 2026, thanks to an agreement with Green Century°.</p>
<p>“We welcome Marriott’s commitment to transparency and to cutting its plastic use,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of the Green Century Funds. “Customers, investors, and business leaders value sustainability, so Marriott is taking the right approach to prepare for the future.”</p>
<p>Regulatory and economic pressures have pushed companies to disclose and reduce the use of non-essential single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Marriott has taken steps toward reducing single-use plastic in its operations, including transitioning away from tiny, single-use toiletry bottles to more-sustainable, larger bottles for bath amenities. The bigger bottles are more recyclable and help reduce plastic waste.</p>
<p>“Given Marriott’s scale, with more than 1.5 million hotel rooms worldwide, small changes make massive impacts,” said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century. “We are pleased that the company is working to create a more sustainable business and planet.”</p>
<p><strong>Plastic Pollution Continues its Explosive Growth</strong></p>
<p>Plastic pollution entering the oceans has been doubling every six years, killing 1 million marine creatures annually. More than 91% of plastics are not recycled.</p>
<p>Experts agree that reducing non-essential single-use plastic is necessary to address the growing plastic pollution crisis.</p>
<p>While some plastic doesn’t have viable alternatives, many single-use applications do.</p>
<p>“Companies first need to understand the scale of the problem and disclose the risks associated with it,” said Guernsey. “Only with reliable information can investors make cogent decisions to reduce the tidal wave of plastic pollution.”</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> The Walt Disney Company* has agreed to disclose how much plastic it’s using in certain areas of its business and to set an additional plastic reduction goal, thanks to an agreement with Green Century Funds°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund. The Walt Disney Company will release its disclosures in 2025 and will publish the additional plastic reduction goal the following year. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<h4><span data-contrast="auto">The new commitments come as regulatory and economic pressures have pushed companies to disclose and reduce the use of non-essential single-use plastic.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“It’s crucial that investors know how a company is addressing its environmental risks and Walt Disney’s commitment will provide important information through its new reporting,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of the Green Century Funds</strong>. “It’s a win for the company since single-use plastic is widely unpopular with consumers who recognize that plastics will pollute our environment for generations to come.”  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Disney had previously taken significant steps towards reducing single-use plastic, including committing to eliminate single-use plastic on cruise ships by 2025, introducing plastic free packaging, and by committing to achieve zero waste to landfill for its wholly owned and operated parks and resorts by 2030.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These new commitments to disclose and to reduce unnecessary plastic will increase transparency and better position the company for a more sustainable future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“The green bottom line is that reducing plastic waste is a win for businesses and for the planet,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century</strong>. “Green Century is excited that the company is committed to these transparency measures that investors will value.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Plastic waste is one of the most durable and growing forms of pollution. It is estimated that every piece of plastic produced in the last 60 years that hasn’t been burned is still in the environment. According to a report from PEW Charitable Trust, if current plastic use trends continue, the amount of plastic leaking into oceans will triple, and the amount of plastic in the oceans will quadruple by 2040. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While many methods will be needed to reduce plastic pollution, recommendations from scientists and experts are for an absolute reduction of single-use plastic. Current recycling methods have resulted in only 9% of plastics being recycled, while most plastics labeled with the chasing arrow label are not actually recyclable. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Alternatives to non-essential single-use plastic already exist,” said Guernsey. “From refillable and reusable containers to recycled paper, corporations have options to reduce risk in this sector. Frankly, much of the single-use plastic we use is like the name states – non-essential.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>

					<p>Contact Information:</p>
<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Good news for families looking to shrink their environmental impact this holiday season. Green Century°, one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds in the U.S., filed three shareholder resolutions asking toy companies Disney*, Hasbro* and Mattel* to cut single-use plastic. Not only is excessive plastic packaging unnecessary and wasteful, but toy companies could also increase long-term value by reducing risks from single-use plastics used to package toys.</p>
<p>“Some toys have more plastic packaging than actual toy – it doesn’t make sense fiscally or environmentally,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “There are real business concerns from single-use plastic, ranging from damaged brand reputation from plastic pollution to legal action because of toxicity. A toy&#8217;s packaging shouldn&#8217;t outlive the people who play with it.”</p>
<h5>It is estimated that American’s household waste increases by more than 25% from Thanksgiving to New Years. Much of this waste comes from plastic packaging.</h5>
<p>Excessive plastic packaging is highly visible and unpopular, and governments have increasingly issued taxes and bans on single-use plastic. Companies also face legal risk, as exemplified by New York state suing PepsiCo over river pollution and the multibillion-dollar fines leveled at manufacturers of plastic additive PFAS, commonly known as forever chemicals.</p>
<p>PFAS is one of the many chemicals manufacturers use in plastic packaging. This and other plastic additives, which are often largely unknown even to companies, are a particular concern for the toy industry as children are more susceptible to the effects of environmental toxins.</p>
<p>“Plastic is hurting wildlife in our oceans, and it&#8217;s also hurting us,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “Of the over 13,000 chemicals associated with plastics and plastic production, most have not been studied or are harmful to humans. Companies need to fully disclose their plastic footprints and commit to reducing all non-essential, single-use plastic.”</p>
<p>While investors are examining the growing issue, representatives from the UN are debating a global plastics treaty that could make companies responsible for the waste they create. Experts have stated that the best way to address the growing plastic crisis is to first reduce plastic use and production, particularly for non-essential single-use plastics, which are defined as plastics that are not absolutely necessary, have available alternatives, and have an intended lifespan of one use or less than 24 hours.</p>

					<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong><br />
Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, (617) 482-0800<br />
Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, November 13)</strong> Green Century° announced today that it has joined major investors in signing two letters urging action on the UN Global Plastics Treaty. <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/plastics-treaty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The UN Global Plastics Treaty</a>, due to be completed in 2024, would create a legally binding international agreement to cover the entire life cycle of plastics.</p>
<p>“UN member countries have a once in a lifetime opportunity to confront the plastics pollution crisis,” said<strong> Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.</strong> “We strongly support the highest level of ambition in the Global Plastic Treaty.”</p>
<p>Plastic pollution is seen as a worldwide crisis and market failure. Nearly 400 million tons of plastics are produced annually, primarily from fossil fuels, creating a carbon footprint of approximately 1.8 billion tons of emissions each year. Plastic is also known to have negative impacts on environmental and human health at every stage of its lifecycle.</p>

<h4>The estimated annual greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production worldwide is more than the emissions from 400 million cars, or greater than of all the cars in North America combined.</h4>
<p>The letter from the Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development to the High Ambition Coalition, signed by Green Century and nearly 30 other institutional investors, urges countries to create a comprehensive, binding agreement to address global plastic design, production, and disposal. It also calls for investments in refillable bottle systems to replace single use plastics.</p>
<p>The second letter, CDP’s Open Letter to Governments, endorsed by 48 financial institutions with over $3.5 trillion AUM, calls for mandatory plastic data disclosure by all plastic producers globally.</p>
<p>Progress has been made in recent years on plastic disclosure, yet many investors, corporations, and governments are still largely unaware of the types and quantities of plastics being produced. Requirements for better transparency are complicated by the more than 13,000 commonly used plastic additives which impact human health and decrease recyclability.</p>
<figure id="attachment_18557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18557" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-18557 size-full" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Graph-Chemicals-Plastic.png" alt="" width="480" height="236" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18557" class="wp-caption-text">The Health Impact of Chemical Additives to Plastic Are Largely Unknown and Unregulated</figcaption></figure>
<h4><strong>Of the over 13,000 chemical additives to plastic, over 70% have adverse impacts on human health or have not yet been the subject of scientific studies. </strong></h4>
<p>“The more you learn about plastics, the clearer the risks become,” <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century.</strong> “Plastic additives increase health and litigation risk for businesses and make plastic harder to recycle. After mandatory disclosure, the next steps are plastic reduction and commonsense solutions like refillable bottles.”</p>

<p>Media Contacts: Josh Chetwynd, jchetwynd@greencentury.com, 303-573-5558; Annalisa Tarizzo, atarizzo@greencentury.com, 617-482-0800</p>



<p><strong>Boston, January 25, 2022 </strong>– Following an engagement with Green Century,° Choice Hotels International, which includes such brands as Comfort Inn &amp; Suites and Econolodge, has announced two new commitments to reducing plastic use across its operations. The chain is one of the largest in the world with franchises in more than 7,000 hotels worldwide.</p>



<p>As part of an agreement with Green Century, Choice Hotels will phase out single-use polystyrene products by the end of 2023 and transition to bulk amenities by the close of 2025 across its domestic brands. The polystyrene commitment excludes the Ascend Collection and the bulk amenity commitment excludes extended stay brands or the Ascend Collection. In its transition to bulk amenities, the company will replace miniature bottles of products like shampoo and conditioner with larger dispensers in order to reduce waste.</p>



<p>“We applaud Choice Hotels’ commitment to reducing its impact on the plastic waste crisis and look forward to seeing the company implement its new goals in the coming years,” said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century.</p>



<p>Green Century filed and then withdrew a shareholder proposal with the company in 2020. This announcement fulfills the withdrawal agreement reached by both parties.</p>



<p>While Choice Hotels has not disclosed how the announcement will impact its plastic use, a similar transition to bulk toiletry dispensers across Marriott’s* portfolio of hotels <a href="https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/2019/oct/16/major-hotels-make-move-bulk-size-toiletries-shift-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulted </a><a href="https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/2019/oct/16/major-hotels-make-move-bulk-size-toiletries-shift-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a </a><a href="https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/2019/oct/16/major-hotels-make-move-bulk-size-toiletries-shift-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30</a><a href="https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/2019/oct/16/major-hotels-make-move-bulk-size-toiletries-shift-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">% reduction in plastic use</a>.</p>



<p>This past year, New York <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/05/27/mini-hotel-toiletries-will-be-illegal-in-new-york-from-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a law</a> banning miniature toiletry bottles from hotels starting in 2024. California <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2019/10/10/california-hotel-bottle-ban-law-prohibits-tiny-plastic-bottles/3928360002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a similar law</a> in 2019.</p>



<p>“As more states pass laws banning single-use plastics, Choice Hotels’ new commitments will help the company mitigate regulatory risk, in addition to reducing the chain’s environmental impact,” Tarizzo said.</p>
