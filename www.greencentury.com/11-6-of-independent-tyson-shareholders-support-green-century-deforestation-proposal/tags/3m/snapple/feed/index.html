					<p><b>Media Contacts: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, asanders@greencentury.com, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Boston, April 18, 2023 –</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Keurig Dr. Pepper*, a leading global beverage company with brands from Snapple to 7Up, will boost efforts to cut single-use plastic by expanding its “reuse and refill” options across the country. In exchange for its heightened focus on plastic reduction, Green Century Funds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> withdrew its shareholder proposal for the company’s 2023 annual meeting calling for a reduction in total plastic packaging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The amount of plastic flowing into our oceans is on pace to </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20plastic%20trash,to%2029%20million%20metric%20tons." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly triple by 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Plastic pollution demands urgent attention from companies and governments around the world. We applaud Keurig Dr. Pepper for stepping up its efforts to address the plastic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keurig Dr. Pepper’s planned actions include expanding its 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report to include more details on refillable and reusable container pilots. Starting in 2023, the company pledged to publish an annual “reuse and refill baseline assessment” in its CSR report. By 2024, the company plans to launch new reuse and refill pilots in key U.S. markets where the local infrastructure and culture are conducive to their success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 9 percent of all plastic made in the last 60 years has been recycled,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Green Century Capital Management’s director of shareholder advocacy. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t recycle our way out of the plastic problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to seeing Keurig Dr. Pepper help build a circular economy by providing more reuse options – from soda cups to K-Cup Pods – in communities across the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Replacing Single-Use Plastics Effectively</b></span><b><br />

They’re also on the rise, with 2022 bringing major commitments from beverage giants </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-coca-cola-announces-refillable-packaging-goal-prompted-by-proposal-from-green-century-and-as-you-sow/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coca-Cola</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/pepsico-reusable-packaging-51670358630" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PepsiCo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide 25% and 20% of their drinks, respectively, in reusable containers by 2030.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These policies are likely influenced by, among other factors, changing c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsumer attitudes on plastics: a December 2022 survey found that over 80% of registered U.S. voters support requiring companies to increase reusable </span><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://usa.oceana.org/press-releases/americans-are-sick-of-single-use-plastic-pollution-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packaging and foodware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Companies such as Keurig Dr. Pepper are beginning to realize that an investment in reusable and refillable containers can mitigate the financial, regulatory, and reputational risks posed by single-use plastics,” added Sanders. “They’re also seeing consumers act, in growing numbers, on the common-sense conviction that nothing we use for five minutes should pollute our planet for hundreds of years.”</span></p>
