					<p><b>Media Contacts: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, June 26, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Green Century° withdrew a shareholder proposal with tech giant Alphabet after the company agreed to provide greater visibility into its use of carbon offsets.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://abc.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alphabet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relies on carbon offsets, also known as carbon credits, to neutralize the emissions it’s not able to eliminate through other methods, such as through energy efficiency or renewable energy. Following the Green Century engagement, the company has now agreed to annually disclose its criteria, approach, and portfolio, including details on project purchases and any relevant certifications related to its purchases of carbon offsets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite earlier commitments and a </span><a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//green/pdfs/google-carbon-offsets.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing its strategy for buying “high-quality carbon offsets,” which are known for longevity and verifiability, Alphabet’s full disclosure in 2022 fell short. In a single sentence in its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual environmental report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company vaguely stated “[We] plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on carbon offsets to neutralize emissions is currently an area of intense debate. Some academics and NGOs are urging potential buyers to be cautious as research about how different projects absorb carbon, methodology for measuring offsets, and ability to verify the durability of the offsets evolve.  At minimum, more robust disclosure may be advised, and the agreement secured by Green Century should help investors better assess  Alphabet’s carbon offset purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m pleased that Alphabet sees the value in revisiting its carbon offsets disclosure policy,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Green Century, and I expect many, many investors, value insight into how Alphabet is managing its climate risk.  I believe embracing transparency will only help it select offsets wisely and avoid the greenwashing label.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has weighed in on the issue. In its proposed climate rule, the </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SEC expresses an interest in learning how companies use carbon offsets to reach their climate-related goals, and the regulator may require companies to disclose their carbon reductions represented by these offsets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alphabet is a leader in many respects &#8211; the amount of renewable energy it procures, the energy efficiency it incorporates, and its ability to maintain carbon neutrality. Becoming a leader in carbon offsets seems like a natural step forward,” added Shareholder Advocate </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I think our proposal was a wake up call for Alphabet. Investors like us are analyzing corporate climate commitments very closely, and we want to see that claims of emissions reductions using offsets are actually true.”</span></p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocacy, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 20, 2023</strong> – General Motors released the results of the shareholder vote on a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/">Green Century</a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/"><em>°</em></a><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-with-general-motors-seeking-deeper-commitment-to-supply-chain-sustainability-new-report-confirms-gm-commitments-lacking/"> proposal</a> asking the company to improve the sustainability of its aluminum, steel, rubber, and leather supply chains. Votes cast in favor reached 14.3% for this first-year proposal, which asked the company to disclose the environmental impacts of these key materials, procure more low-carbon aluminum and steel, and eliminate deforestation associated with producing leather and rubber.</p>
<p>In recent years, General Motors has set several <a href="https://www.gmsustainability.com/_pdf/resources-and-downloads/GM_2022_SR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggressive targets</a> – one to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 and another to make and sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035. However, the company has not established clear targets for procuring green steel or aluminum, even though both industries can electrify some of their operations and use renewable energy to do so. Further, GM has yet to join industry associations such as <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a><a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><sup>TM</sup></a>, a coalition which created a certification system for green steel and is working to increase customer demand for green steel manufacturing.</p>
<p>Additionally, GM may be sourcing leather and rubber used for car interiors and tires from areas that are associated with deforestation. For example, in Brazil, which is considered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major source of leather</a> for U.S. auto manufacturers, raising cattle is a leading cause of deforestation. The growth and expansion of rubber plantations in Southeast Asia and West Africa – the two primary areas in the world where latex for car tires is harvested – threatens the destruction of biodiverse ecosystems in those regions. Nevertheless, GM currently lacks public targets, milestones and metrics that would indicate progress toward eliminating its exposure to deforestation from rubber plantation expansion or destruction of tropical forests from cattle ranching.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said:</strong></p>
<p>“We believe that even with a full transition to electric cars and trucks by 2035, GM has exposure to significant environmental risks. Ultimately, we don’t think GM wants to be associated with deforestation. If the company wants to clean up its steel and aluminum supply chains, it should invest now in the transition to low-carbon steel and aluminum. Waiting only postpones much needed emissions cuts across the globe.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, Green Century shareholder advocate, added:   </strong></p>
<p>“As one of the largest auto companies in the world, GM has a leadership role to play in addressing climate and deforestation risk. Many European auto companies, such as BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Volvo, are making commitments to source low-carbon metals. GM has an opportunity to catch up and lead the way for American manufacturers. Moreover, few manufacturers are addressing deforestation risk within their supply chains. GM could set an industry-wide standard by adopting near-term targets for zero deforestation.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, June 2, 2023</strong> &#8211; Shareholders have weighed in on a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century° and the Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asking McDonald’s to establish a more ambitious policy to eliminate use of medically important antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains. McDonald’s published the vote tally on Thursday which showed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390823000059/mcd-20230525.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.6% of votes cast</a> were in favor of the proposal.</p>
<p>In its opposition statement, McDonald’s acknowledges that antimicrobial resistance “is a critical global public health issue that we believe we and our suppliers have a responsibility to help address.” The term antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often used interchangeably with antibiotic resistance, but can also describe non-bacterial resistant diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies antimicrobial resistance as a global public health crisis that threatens to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0712-Antimicrobial-Resistance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse medical progress</a>, and the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies antimicrobial resistance as “one of the top <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 global public health threats</a> facing humanity.”</p>
<p>Although McDonald’s first publicized that it would address antibiotic resistance in its food animal supply chain in 2003, it didn’t set reduction targets until 2017, which were narrowly focused on its chicken supply chain. Further, the targets aimed to eliminate only the antibiotics that are highly critical to medicine, failing to protect a wide range of other important antibiotics that humans use to fight infections.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment/">proposal</a> filed by Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters asked McDonald’s to establish a policy that would not only eliminate routine use of all medically important human antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains, but push the company to establish timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, and guidelines for enforcement should suppliers fail to meet McDonald’s targets.</p>
<p>In December 2022, McDonald’s did <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> reduction, but not elimination, targets that are limited to its beef supply chain in its top 10 markets.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said:</strong></p>
<p>“McDonald’s shareholders have signaled that they want to hold McDonald’s responsible for not living up to its commitments, especially when it comes to animal welfare and protecting human health. We’ll continue to work with the company, but we won’t be satisfied until it takes steps necessary to protect the effectiveness of antibiotics, which are crucial to public health. We’re looking for both action and accountability on its part.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, Green Century Shareholder Advocate, stated:   </strong></p>
<p>“McDonald’s is the largest fast food restaurant in the world. As such, it has the influence to change the way food animals are raised and has the responsibility to protect public health from malicious germs which include dangerous bacteria. When I bite into a Big Mac, I want to know that the beef was sourced responsibly and that it was raised without using antibiotics that I, and society in general, need to stay healthy and whole.”</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>Boston, May 2, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gcchubb032723-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In March giving Chubb Limited permission to block Green Century Funds’ </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shareholder proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal requests Chubb adopt a policy for the time-bound phase out of underwriting new coal, oil, and gas projects. Green Century</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed a similar proposal in 2022, asking for an immediate cessation of underwriting new projects. Chubb challenged last year’s proposal, but, at that time, the SEC ruled the proposal could appear on Chubb’s 2022 ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chubb is the largest publicly-traded property and casualty insurance company and is actively involved in underwriting oil and gas project risks. For example, Chubb has previously underwritten policies for controversial fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Trans Mountain pipeline. A 2022 report exposed Chubb as a major underwriter of liability and transportation risks for offshore oil drilling operations for Petrobras – Brazil’s national oil company – which has the </span><a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fifth largest oil and gas expansion plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of any oil and gas company in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re disappointed that Chubb did not want its shareholders to vote on this issue and that the SEC supported Chubb’s argument, claiming that our proposal requires shareholders to ‘probe too deeply’ into Chubb’s core business. We think shareholders understand insurance is essential for coal, oil and gas companies, and many do not believe increasingly expensive drilling and its associated emissions are good for business,” said Green Century Funds President </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve asked Chubb to phase out insurance for new projects that will likely create decades of greenhouse gas  emissions. It’s hard to square how Chubb enables carbon pollution while simultaneously issuing policies to protect people’s homes and businesses from the impacts of climate change.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the SEC’s ruling, Chubb had announced </span><a href="https://about.chubb.com/#:~:text=Chubb%20is%20the%20world&#039;s%20largest,health%20insurance%2C%20reinsurance%20and%20life" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new underwriting criteria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for oil and gas extraction projects requiring existing clients to reduce methane emissions. Additionally, Chubb said it would no longer provide coverage for oil and gas projects in state- or nationally-designated protected areas and in certain other conservation areas. Green Century Funds welcomed action but also </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-chubb-announces-new-policy-to-restrict-its-underwriting-of-oil-and-gas-sector-green-century-seeks-details-on-how-effectively-it-will-reduce-carbon-emissions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critiqued the new policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, indicating that its potential for reducing greenhouse emissions was unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For two years, we have been pressing Chubb to uphold its duty to protect its shareholders and customers from climate risk,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We believe helping the fossil fuel industry is completely contrary to its fiduciary and prudential responsibilities. These actions aid and abet an industry that has done the most to contribute to a warming planet. Insurers like Chubb have to show more leadership because they are on the front lines of experiencing climate risk.”</span></p>

					<p><b>Media Contacts: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, </span><a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aranger@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 781-349-2813;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pam Podger, Communications Director, </span><a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ppodger@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 860-822-3887</span></p>
<p><b>BOSTON, April 26, 2023 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– After filing shareholder proposals with each company, Green Century° successfully secured commitments with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.,* Intel Corporation,* NVIDIA Corporation,*  ON Semiconductor Corporation,* and Texas Instruments, Inc.* requesting they publish climate transition plans. Climate transition plans detail companies&#8217; near- and medium-term strategies and future actions deemed necessary to reaching their greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations describes such plans as an “</span><a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/high-level_expert_group_n7b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essential tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” for building public trust, helping companies align “governance and incentive structures, capital expenditures, research and development, skills and human resource development, and public advocacy…” with their targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pressure to plan for and achieve steep emissions cuts comes not only from investors, but from the semiconductor industry itself. The Semiconductor Climate Consortium, which is an initiative of  the microelectronics industry group SEMI, urges its members to set net-zero emissions targets and to transparently report progress. Additionally, semiconductor company customers that have net-zero emissions reduction targets, such as Apple,* Google,* and Microsoft,* are increasingly eyeing their chip suppliers as they look to eliminate their upstream emissions.</span></p>
<h3><b>Climate Transition Plans Help Investors Assess Companies’ Progress In Limiting Climate Change</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe each company recognizes the value of producing climate transition plans for investors and that their leadership will encourage peers and competitors to do the same,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Investors increasingly need visibility into companies’ assumptions, opportunities, barriers, and emissions reduction pathways as they move toward fulfilling their emissions reduction targets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semiconductor chip manufacturing is energy intensive and relies heavily on electricity to power furnaces, manufacturing equipment, and to maintain clean rooms. As a result, companies like Intel, NVIDIA, and ON Semiconductor are looking to source 100% renewable energy for their operations.  However, semiconductor manufacturing also uses gases that are essential  to completing chip designs, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs). PFCs have a global warming potential that is thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide, and the gases are currently much more difficult to replace with less potent alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The semiconductor industry has some very real challenges to overcome in order to secure a path to net-zero emissions,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger, “The idea of climate transition plans is relatively new, but for Green Century, they couldn’t come quickly enough. The window of time for limiting devastating climate impacts is so narrow; we need to know that companies are planning and doing their part to ensure a livable future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranger added, “I want to acknowledge Advanced Micro Devices and ON Semiconductor, especially, for agreeing to create the most comprehensive transition plans I’ve seen yet. All five companies, however, deserve praise for their new commitments.” </span></p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Director of Communications, ppodger@greencentury.com, 860-822-3887</p>
<p><strong>Boston, April 20, 2023</strong> &#8212; On April 10th, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) upheld Amazon.com Inc.’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gccmamazon040723-14a8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request </a>to block a Green Century° and Amalgamated Bank shareholder proposal from its 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal seeks full disclosure of Amazon&#8217;s scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, which includes emissions associated with the production and use of third-party products and transportation, waste generation, and business travel. Amazon currently publishes only a portion of its scope 3 emissions.</p>
<p>Amazon competitors Walmart and Target quantify, estimate where needed, and disclose all relevant categories of their scope 3 value chain emissions, as defined by the widely-referenced GHG Protocol. In its argument to the SEC, Amazon claimed that Green Century and Amalgamated Bank’s proposal, which asked it to report on its entire emissions footprint according to Protocol guidelines, constituted micromanagement. However, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2023/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon failed to emphasize</a> in its letter to the SEC that it currently reports by using the Protocol’s definitions for the scopes 1 &#8211; 3 emissions that it does <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2021-ghg-verification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclose</a>.</p>
<p>Industry experts report that scope 3 emissions often constitute between 70% and 99% of companies’ greenhouse gas emissions footprint, and according to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/09/scope-emissions-climate-greenhouse-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Economic Forum</a>, “Companies will need to cut emissions across all three scopes to meet internationally agreed targets on global warming.” By not accounting for its full greenhouse gas footprint, Amazon may be failing to address all emissions related to running its ecommerce, retail stores, and web services. The company may be in danger of failing to meet its ambitious climate goals.</p>
<p>In reaction to the news, Green Century President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a> expressed disappointment, “Amazon has been a leader on climate by aggressively developing wind projects and supporting the roll out of electric vehicle delivery trucks. It’s troubling that Amazon is blocking shareholders from expressing their opinions on the company’s full exposure to climate risk.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Amazon and the firm, Global Optimism, launched the <a href="https://www.theclimatepledge.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climate Pledge</a>, inviting companies across the globe to “commit to net-zero by 2040 across all emissions scopes.” It is yet unclear the scopes of emissions that Amazon includes in its net-zero by 2040 goal. Walmart and Target report that 97% and  95% of their emissions come from scope 3 sources. According to Amazon, its scope 3 emissions represent only 78% of its total emissions &#8211; that is, only for the scope 3 emissions it actually publishes.</p>
<p>“How are we supposed to assess Amazon’s full climate risk if it’s holding back material information from investors and stakeholders?” questioned Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “Amazon is undermining other companies’ good faith efforts to disclose upstream, downstream, and operational emissions. As the UN Secretary just quipped, &#8216;Our world needs climate action on all fronts: everything, everywhere, all at once.’ Disclosure and action are key to reaching the world’s climate goals.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, mmorgenstein@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 22, 2023</strong> &#8211; In response to Green Century<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i> re-filing of a shareholder proposal in December, Chubb Limited, the world’s largest commercial property and casualty insurer, has once again asked the SEC for permission to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block the proposal</a> from its proxy ballot. In 2022, Green Century filed a virtually identical <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">proposal</a> asking the company to stop underwriting new coal, oil and methane gas projects. The SEC denied Chubb’s request. Subsequently, the proposal went to a vote at Chubb’s 2022 annual general meeting and garnered the support of <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb/">19.4% of the shareholder votes cast</a>.</p>
<p>Like most U.S. property and casualty insurers, Chubb lags behind its European peers in adopting meaningful exclusions. Despite the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and constraints on fossil fuel supply,<a href="https://global.insure-our-future.com/worlds-largest-reinsurer-announces-major-new-oil-and-gas-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">  </a>a number of European property and casualty insurers now exclude more oil and methane gas development in their fossil fuel underwriting.  By contrast, in January 2022, a global NGO insurance campaign identified Chubb as a major underwriter of South American offshore oil and gas drilling projects, providing Brazil’s national oil company coverage for 60% of its general civil liability and 50% of its transport-related risks. This state-owned Brazilian company has the fifth-largest documented oil and gas expansion plans of any oil and gas company in the world.</p>
<p>“It boggles the mind to think that an insurance company would willingly create risk for itself and its shareholders by supporting new fossil fuel supply,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “We have to transition away from fuels that create carbon pollution and drive global warming. And let me be clear: We’re not asking Chubb to summarily cancel existing contracts. We’re asking Chubb to be more forward-thinking about a slice of its business and phase out of underwriting new fossil fuel projects. It’s a low bar to clear considering the existential risk of climate change.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/corpfin/no-action/14a-8/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chubb argued to the SEC</a> that Green Century’s proposal should be excluded because it probes too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.</p>
<p>“Chubb’s argument seems to underestimate the intelligence of its shareholders,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a>. “I’m sure many are able to come to the fairly obvious conclusion that insurance policies enabling new coal, oil and gas supplies are fueling increasingly severe climate change impacts. It’s not rocket science.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, mmorgenstein@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</p>
<p><strong>Boston, December 15, 2022</strong> – Green Century° and Amalgamated Bank led the filing of a shareholder proposal Thursday pressing Amazon to fully quantify and disclose its scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 3 emissions, which include things such as transportation that occur outside of a company’s direct control, can represent an enormous portion of a retailer’s carbon footprint. Last year, Walmart and Target reported on every category of their scope 3 emissions, which comprised 95% and 97% of their total greenhouse gas output, respectively. By contrast, Amazon reported on only a portion of its scope 3 emissions.</p>
<p>For example, in 2021, Amazon only disclosed product-related emissions for its Amazon-branded products such as Kindles, Fire TVs or Whole Foods’ 365 products. However, private-label products represent a mere 1% of its sales. The rest of the products it sells directly or through third party vendors, comprise 39% and 60% of total sales, respectively. Unlike Amazon, Walmart and Target do not parse out emissions from their private-label brands versus products from other manufacturers or products sold on their third-party platforms. It’s likely, therefore, that Amazon is significantly undercounting its total emissions.</p>
<p>“What Amazon is doing &#8212; or, should I say, not doing &#8212; is not acceptable,” said Green Century Funds President <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>. “It needs to play by the same set of rules as everyone else and disclose all indirect emissions up and down its value chain. As climate-concerned investors, we believe Amazon has a responsibility to use its vast resources and influence to reduce its burgeoning carbon footprint.”</p>
<h3><strong>Emissions grow but Amazon’s greenhouse gas emissions disclosures are still lacking</strong></h3>
<p>In 2019, Amazon launched an ambitious initiative called the Climate Pledge, inviting other companies to commit to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 &#8212; 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement’s target year of 2050. Since that time, Amazon’s sales have nearly doubled, in large part due to pandemic-fueled at-home purchasing; consequently, Amazon’s greenhouse gas emissions &#8212; at least the ones it discloses &#8212; have risen by nearly 40% in the same time period.</p>
<p>“Walmart and Target are doing the math for all the brands they sell &#8211; from bottles of Tide to Samsung TVs. They’re adding up all the emissions that go into making the bottle, the laundry detergent, the energy used by the washing machine, and they’re counting the emissions that go into the parts and pieces of the TV, and the electricity used to run the TV once it’s home,” Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Andrea Ranger</a> said. “This accounting is important because you can’t manage what you can’t measure. We fully expect that Walmart and Target will use their influence to lean on manufacturers to cut their emissions in smart and timely ways. Amazon needs to get on board and do likewise – now.”</p>
