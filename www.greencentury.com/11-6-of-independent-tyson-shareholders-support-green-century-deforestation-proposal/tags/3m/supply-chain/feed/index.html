<p><span data-contrast="auto">Much of this work happens on the computer or over the phone, but there is nothing like meeting in person &#8211; partially because you never know what to expect.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This spring I attended a shareholder meeting at Builders FirstSource* in Dallas that was so empty, at first, I thought I was in the wrong place. I was waiting completely on my own in a 100-seat event room when suddenly I was joined by a small handful of executives from the company.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With so few of us in the room, th</span><span data-contrast="auto">e CEO, General Counsel and I discussed Green Century’s proposal, which asked the company to commit to reducing carbon emissions associated with timber harvesting and other supply chain issues.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>

While we didn’t agree on everything, we had a productive conversation, and I commend Builders FirstSource CEO Dave Rush for connecting to address environmental risks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As a result of Green Century’s engagement, for the first time Builders FirstSource measured and disclosed its CO2 emissions from its operations and transportation and stated it would set emissions reduction targets. The company still has significant work to do, including measuring its emissions from timber harvesting, setting efficiency targets for its supply chain, and prioritizing sourcing FSC certified lumber. We will continue to work with the company to achieve these goals.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}"> </span></p>
