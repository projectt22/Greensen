										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>From protecting forests to diverting plastic bottles from landfills for use in products, Williams-Sonoma Inc. is one of the many sustainable holdings in the Green Century Equity Fund.<br><br>The high-end home furnishings store, founded in 1973, made its first CDP climate disclosure about five years ago in an effort cut waste, source responsibly and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>Many of the company’s brands are well recognized names, including Williams-Sonoma Home, Pottery Barn, West Elm and more, and the company has operations around the globe. Chuck Williams launched the first store in 1956 after converting space formerly used as a small hardware store in Sonoma, Calif. Ten years ago, the landmark store was reopened in its original location.</p>



<p>The company has set science-based targets to cut emissions across its value chain by 2030 and aims to have all operations carbon neutral by year’s end.<br><br>Williams-Sonoma is working across its myriads of brands to operate in a more environmentally responsible manner. This includes cutting its carbon footprint, incorporating recycled plastics in fibers used for products, and responsibly sourcing wood and cotton for many products.<br><br>For example, the organic cotton in its sheets, rugs and other products is grown without harmful chemicals and pesticides, which helps contribute to cleaner soil and waterways. Wood for furniture and household items are sourced from FSC sources, or those approved by the <a href="https://fsc.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest Stewardship Council.</a><br><br>The company works with a sustainable textile manufacturer, <a href="https://unifi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unifi</a>, that diverts plastic bottles to make high-quality, recycled fibers that are used in Williams Sonoma’s pillows, bedding, furniture and other products. These fibers, Williams-Sonoma says, also release fewer greenhouse gas emissions, offset the use of new petroleum, and conserve water and energy.<br><br>So far, the company has diverted 93 million plastic bottles to date. Further, Unifi named Williams-Sonoma a Champion of Sustainability.<br><br><em>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em><br><br>Williams-Sonoma is one of the companies in <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/equity-fund/">Green Century’s Equity Fund</a> and is working to improve its environmental impact.</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 9, 2024</strong>  – Ford Motor Company shareholders delivered 6.6<strong>%</strong> of votes cast in support of Green Century’s<em>°</em> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000110465924040871/tm2318496-d4_def14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resolution</a> asking the company to eliminate materials linked to deforestation in its cars and trucks. The proposal also asked Ford to buy more sustainable steel and aluminum, and pushed for the company to purchase steel and aluminum plants that run off of clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>The Ford family has significant control over Ford business decisions because it owns a special class of stock that ensures it has  <a href="https://quartr.com/insights/business-philosophy/the-ford-family-a-permanent-mark-in-business-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% of the voting power</a>. Votes against the Green Century proposal by Ford family members could have negatively impacted the vote result.</p>
<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raising cattle</a>, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harvesting rubber</a>, and <a href="https://en.tempo.co/read/1827220/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mining minerals</a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage in vulnerable areas such as Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. Deforestation is now one of the leading drivers of <a href="https://www.tsijournals.com/abstract/deforestation-causing-global-warming-and-climate-change-11492.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climate change</a> and <a href="https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/how-does-deforestation-impact-wildlife-and-biodiversity-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biodiversity loss.</a></p>
<p>Heavy emitting industries such as steel and aluminum also contribute to climate change. Currently, not a single ton of sustainable steel and aluminum is manufactured in the United States. Green Century’s proposal asks Ford to join organizations like <a href="https://www.responsiblesteel.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResponsibleSteel</a> and the <a href="https://aluminium-stewardship.org/drive-change/sustainability-priorities/climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aluminum Stewardship Initiative</a>, which  develop sustainability certifications for aluminum and steel manufacturers and push them to replace fossil fuels with renewables.</p>
<p>“While we had wished for a higher vote, we’re pleased with the support we received,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “Enhancing supply chain sustainably at Ford is a new initiative for us, and we plan to keep pressure on the company to address its material environmental risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Supply Chains Are Key</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, Ford set a target to purchase sustainable steel and aluminum for <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/11/09/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10% of its total steel and aluminum purchases by 2030</a>. The company also planned to <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/04/ford-updates-timing-for-next-gen-evs--readies-manufacturing-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add EVs to its fleet</a>, which are manufactured with more aluminum than gas-powered cars to offset the extra battery weight. The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative works to ensure that aluminum producers are cutting emissions significantly by 2025. Similarly, ResponsibleSteel has a mission to “&#8230;be a driving force in the socially and environmentally responsible production of net-zero steel, globally.” Ford may benefit by joining both organizations, using its influence as a major consumer of steel and aluminum to press for greener production.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone wants to buy a Ford Explorer or F-150 and learn that the leather, rubber, and minerals in their vehicles contributed to deforestation,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. “Sustainability needs to be woven into every aspect of Ford’s supply chain, because Green Century believe it’s good for Ford’s investors, customers, and the company itself.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[						<div class="single-post-body wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					<p><strong>Boston &#8211; </strong>Mattel, Inc.*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to report on its single-use plastic in packaging to the standardized reporting framework CDP in 2025 after reaching an agreement with <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century</a>°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>Mattel uses plastic packaging for its popular toy brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, and continues to develop ways to improve the sustainability of its packaging.</p>
<p>“We have tremendous respect for the team at Mattel and applaud the company’s commitment to transparency,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Accurate data is critical for decision making, and this new commitment will let investors look ‘into the box’ to view how Mattel is reducing plastic waste.”</p>
<p>Mattel and Green Century had previously reached a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/">deal</a> in which Mattel agreed to set a company-wide plastic reduction goal. Mattel fulfilled that agreement in 2022 by committing to reduce its plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030.</p>
<p>This additional commitment to disclose information on single-use plastic in packaging to CDP will help stakeholders better understand Mattel’s sustainable packaging efforts through a recognized, standardized reporting platform.</p>
<h3><strong>Mattel to join 3,000 global companies reporting to CDP Plastic</strong></h3>
<p>Standardized reporting is an essential first step in reducing plastic pollution.</p>
<p>“Right now, each company discloses plastic information in different ways, making it nearly impossible for governments, recyclers, and investors to really know what plastic is out there,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We really view CDP as the gold standard when it comes to voluntary disclosure.”</p>
<h3><strong>Plastic pollution continues explosive growth</strong></h3>
<p>The current plastic waste system has failed to keep plastic out of the ecosystem. Only <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/campaigns/beyond-plastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastic waste is recycled</a>, while plastic pollution has doubled every six years.</p>
<p>Plastic waste makes its way into waterways, killing marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, as plastic doesn’t break down like other materials, small particles of “<a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/updates/microplastics-in-100-of-the-co-waterways-we-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics</a>” have been found in every environment and even the human bloodstream.</p>
<p>The issue has increasingly alarmed consumers and investors. Over <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of respondents to a recent survey have asked companies to use less single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Companies’ efforts to improve sustainability of their products and packaging are an important aspect of helping to protect the planet for future generations.</p>

								<div class="single-post-content wp-block-column wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
					<p><strong>(Boston) </strong>Microsoft Corporation* <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be offering extended security updates (ESU) for Microsoft Education customers at a discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century°</a>, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/microsoft-extends-security-support-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal/">pushed</a> Microsoft to announce affordable ESU for Windows 10 computers. This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest jump in junked computers ever</a>.</p>
<p>“This allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong>, President of <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century Funds</a>. “It is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.”</p>
<p>An estimated <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/10/windows_11_adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">330-400 million devices</a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000 petition signatures</a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.</p>
<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment</strong></h3>
<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.</p>
<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>
<p>“Getting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey</strong>, shareholder advocate. “We encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.”</p>
