										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there is no regulated term for sustainable investing and may mean and be defined differently from firm to firm, there is growing public and regulatory pressure to provide clear descriptions so that individuals can decide for themselves if the offered investments meet their criteria.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><b><span data-contrast="none">How to Invest Sustainably</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Green Century believes that to </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/sustainable-investment-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">invest sustainably</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">  then you must avoid environmentally dangerous industries. With that step, you don’t invest in industries that you don’t want to support. For example, if you are concerned about climate change, you don’t have to invest your money in the stocks of oil and gas companies. Or if you care about tobacco addiction or  factory farms and animal welfare, you can avoid the companies that make these products or are leaders in these industries. All the Green Century Funds have exclusionary screens to avoid environmentally dangerous companies. The Green Century Balanced Fund also invests in green and sustainable bonds that fund clean energy projects.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><b><span data-contrast="none">What is the Impact of Sustainable Investing</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sustainable investing helps you align your investments with your values, but does it really help the environment or society? Green Century believes that sustainable investing does make an impact when large groups of people decide to avoid certain industries. This  was the case in battling apartheid in South Africa when individuals and institutions moved their investments out of companies that were doing business in the country.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the last 10 years, the fossil fuel divestment movement has helped shape the sustainable investing field and inspired individuals to divest from fossil fuels and influence their institutions – from Harvard University to the New York Pension Fund – to move their money. So far, nearly 1,500 organizations with assets of more than $39.2 trillion have committed to divest from fossil fuels.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This sustainable investing movement has helped the environment by getting investors to question the long-term viability of the fossil fuel industry once they understand the industry’s plans. The concomitant media attention also helped raise awareness for investors and the public. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Green Century Funds have been helping people invest sustainably since 1991. The Green Century Funds are one of the first families of environmentally responsible fossil fuel free mutual funds and has been a champion of the divest-invest movement since the beginning. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there is no one way for how to invest sustainably, there are many options. If you are looking to invest in mutual funds for yourself or a family member, we encourage you to go beyond the marketing taglines and names of funds and see how each one defines its approach.
