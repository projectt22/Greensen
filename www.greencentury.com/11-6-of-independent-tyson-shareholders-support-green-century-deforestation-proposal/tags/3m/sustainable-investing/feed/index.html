<p class="has-text-align-left">Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds°, was named to this year&#8217;s Forbes’ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/50over50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 Over 50 list</a> in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2024/08/01/50-over-50-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investment category</a>, joining the ranks of venture capitalists, wealth managers, philanthropists and others.</p>



<p>The list celebrates women who are pioneers in their fields, leveraging their age and experience as tools for success. The thousands of nominations are narrowed down to 200 finalists in four categories of impact, innovation, investment and lifestyle. This is the fourth year of the annual list and it highlights women who are hitting peaks during life’s second half.</p>



<p>“I am delighted to have been chosen for this recognition and look forward to meeting other prominent changemakers in the fall,” she said. “Green Century applauds the dedication and effort of those involved in this endeavor.”</p>



<p>The list was produced over five months in partnership with Mika Brzezinski and her <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/knowyourvalue?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Pardot&amp;utm_content=EM_1" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.msnbc.com/knowyourvalue?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Pardot&amp;utm_content=EM_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Know Your Value</a> initiative. A team of Forbes reporters, editors, industry experts, alums and others chose the finalists for the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/50over50/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/50over50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 Over 50 list</a>.</p>



<p>An October event in New York City will celebrate the women picked for the list.</p>

					<h3>Green Century Pushed Microsoft to Extend Security Support to Prevent E-Waste</h3>
<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> &#8211; After engagement with <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/">Green Century</a>°, Microsoft Corporation* announced it would extend Windows 10 security updates (ESU) for organizations of all sizes, including schools, the public sector, and for the first time, individuals. Microsoft will provide security updates options to devices using Windows 10 past their End of Support (EOS) date of October 14, 2025.</p>
<p>“Your computer shouldn’t become trash just because it can’t get a security update,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “Microsoft’s move may save vital institutions like hospitals and schools billions of dollars and could prevent millions of functioning computers from becoming toxic e-waste.”</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_18681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18681" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-18681" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Microsfot-300x158.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="158" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18681" class="wp-caption-text">Green Century Pushed Microsoft to Extend Security Support</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>An estimated 330-400 million devices may not be able to upgrade from Windows 10 because of hardware requirements. Microsoft planned End of Support (EOS) date could lead users to dispose of Windows devices which are not eligible to upgrade because of security concerns.</p>
<p>Reports brought to light and campaigns by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) have suggested that the End of Support for Windows 10 could cause the single biggest jump in junked computers ever.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s new Extended Security Update (ESU) program will cost a fee, the details of which will be released at a later date. The plan for commercial customers such as schools, the public sector, and small and mid-sized businesses will be available for three years. The consumer plan will be available initially for one year.</p>
<h3>Microsoft’s commitment is a good step forward, but the cost of the program could be a barrier to access and remains an issue.</h3>
<p>Critics are concerned that the undisclosed cost of ESUs may limit access to the ESU plan and thus reduce the program’s positive environmental impact. Experts suggest that 33% of computers using Windows 10 will not be able to update to Windows 11 because of hardware requirements. This could lead users to discard their devices prematurely out of concern for performance issues and exposure to security risks, which in turn will cause otherwise working computers to end up in landfills. E-waste is the fastest growing form of waste, yet only a small percentage of it is recycled.</p>
<p>“Microsoft is clearly thinking about its long-term environmental impact by extending critical security updates beyond the End of Support of Windows 10,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “Now the company should make these important updates as widely accessible &#8211; and affordable &#8211; as possible.”</p>
<p>The vast majority of the environmental impact of electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry. According to the World Economic Forum, extending the lifespan of phones from three to four years could reduce the number of phones sent to waste by 25%.</p>

<p><strong>(Boston, October 11)</strong> The Green Century° Equity Fund has filed a shareholder resolution with Deere &amp; Company* asking the company to issue a public report assessing the potential damage to the brand’s reputation from opposing Right to Repair legislation.</p>
<p>Deere, the iconic tractor company, has received significant scrutiny for its opposition to “Right to Repair” laws, which allow farmers to access diagnostic software, parts and instructions to repair their own machinery. A class-action lawsuit filed against Deere by farmers alleges that the company violated antitrust laws by restricting repair to dealerships, which increased company profits while hurting farmers.</p>
<p>Shareholders Concerned That Deere Is Not Doing Enough to Support Right to Repair</p>
<p>Recent polls indicate that an overwhelming 84% of Americans support Right to Repair legislation. In April 2023, Colorado became the first state to enact Right to Repair laws specifically targeting farm equipment. To date, 30 additional states have introduced Right to Repair bills, highlighting the growing momentum behind the issue.</p>
<p>While Deere recently signed a “memorandum of understanding” (MOU) with The American Farm Bureau Federation which would allow farmers to buy access to repair information, the agreement has come under scrutiny. According to the MOU, the Farm Bureau would be restricted from advocating for enforceable legislation, and Deere would be allowed to pull out of the agreement if any legislation is passed.</p>
<h3>Deere Opposed Right to Repair on Flimsy Grounds</h3>
<p>There are also concerns that in its rush to oppose Right to Repair legislation, Deere may have made misleading statements in federal filings regarding the environmental consequences of repair.</p>
<p>Deere claimed that existing EPA regulations and the Clean Air Act were some of the reasons that it would not give independent repair shops access to its diagnostic tools. In August 2023, however, the EPA issued a statement that it had no policy on restricting owners’ repairs of emissions-related components of their products to properly function.</p>
<p>Green Century previously filed a shareholder proposal with Deere on the same issue in 2021. Shareholders were unable to vote on the measure as Deere petitioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to exclude the proposal from the ballot. At the time, Green Century° President Leslie Samuelrich said, “Deere seems to be more focused on stifling shareholder concerns than addressing them. Spending time and energy on an SEC challenge could be put to better use by making their products better serve their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there is no regulated term for sustainable investing and may mean and be defined differently from firm to firm, there is growing public and regulatory pressure to provide clear descriptions so that individuals can decide for themselves if the offered investments meet their criteria.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span><b><span data-contrast="none">How to Invest Sustainably</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Green Century believes that to </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/sustainable-investment-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-contrast="none">invest sustainably</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">  then you must avoid environmentally dangerous industries. With that step, you don’t invest in industries that you don’t want to support. For example, if you are concerned about climate change, you don’t have to invest your money in the stocks of oil and gas companies. Or if you care about tobacco addiction or  factory farms and animal welfare, you can avoid the companies that make these products or are leaders in these industries. All the Green Century Funds have exclusionary screens to avoid environmentally dangerous companies. The Green Century Balanced Fund also invests in green and sustainable bonds that fund clean energy projects.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sustainable investing helps you align your investments with your values, but does it really help the environment or society? Green Century believes that sustainable investing does make an impact when large groups of people decide to avoid certain industries. This  was the case in battling apartheid in South Africa when individuals and institutions moved their investments out of companies that were doing business in the country.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In the last 10 years, the fossil fuel divestment movement has helped shape the sustainable investing field and inspired individuals to divest from fossil fuels and influence their institutions – from Harvard University to the New York Pension Fund – to move their money. So far, nearly 1,500 organizations with assets of more than $39.2 trillion have committed to divest from fossil fuels.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">This sustainable investing movement has helped the environment by getting investors to question the long-term viability of the fossil fuel industry once they understand the industry’s plans. The concomitant media attention also helped raise awareness for investors and the public. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The Green Century Funds have been helping people invest sustainably since 1991. The Green Century Funds are one of the first families of environmentally responsible fossil fuel free mutual funds and has been a champion of the divest-invest movement since the beginning. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">While there is no one way for how to invest sustainably, there are many options.

					<description><![CDATA[Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green Century Funds° helps investors make an impact for the planet through a sustainable investing strategy, partners with its investment advisor in an award-winning shareholder advocacy program, and a unique ownership model that sends 100% of our net profits to support the environmental campaign work of our nonprofit owners.</p>
<p>One question we often get is, “How do you decide what issues to work on”?</p>
<p>This is an excellent question. There’s no shortage of issues facing our environment, and it can be hard to decide where to start making a difference. The good news is that while our planet may have more problems than it deserves, we’re finding more solutions every day to help fix them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17905" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="177" /></p>
<p>Shareholder advocacy is a key way that Green Century Funds helps bring about solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. Shareholder advocacy is a tool used by investors to push a company to report on or change a policy. Green Century negotiates with companies to improve their sustainability practices by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, protecting ocean wildlife from plastic pollution, adopting sustainable agriculture policies and more. Then, once companies make commitments, we assess their progress and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>To choose our priority issues, we evaluate a number of factors. First, we’re Green Century Funds for a reason – we’re all about protecting the environment. So, our first consideration is, how can we make the biggest impact for the planet? These issues run the gamut from stopping global warming, protecting endangered species, preserving forests or reducing plastic waste. We evaluate today’s most pressing issues which, if we can win concrete changes to corporate policy, will produce the most profound benefits for ecosystems around the world?</p>
<p>Then, we think about our comparative advantage. Where can we uniquely advance change? Where does our expertise lie? What emerging frameworks and targets can companies implement to mitigate environmental risks? On which issues can we make the strongest business case for action?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19274 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/raze-solar-pIcseKMisrs-unsplash-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></p>
<p>At the end of the day, there’s no one issue that merits all of our attention; the threats facing our planet are multifaceted and ever evolving. But one thing we do know is that to ensure we have a planet to operate businesses on in the future, companies need to figure out now how to give back more than they take. And since nature is everybody&#8217;s business, there&#8217;s no company that can stand on the sidelines.</p>
<p>This coming shareholder season, which runs on a schedule similar to a school year, we’re focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting forests around the world by convincing food and consumer goods companies to protect biodiversity by addressing their nature-related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, as well as by establishing science-based targets for nature that will protect our planet for generations to come.</li>
<li>Reducing plastic pollution by pressing companies to use less plastic in their packaging, especially new plastic, and to scale up reuse models that will help drive a circular economy.</li>
<li>Asking companies that have set goals to reduce their contribution to climate change to develop climate transition plans that chart how the company will hit their targets and move toward a clean energy economy.</li>
<li>Expanding the number of companies with Right to Repair policies that help consumers and reduce dangerous electronic waste.</li>
<li>Pressing insurance companies – which, ironically, are pulling coverage from areas prone to natural disasters exacerbated by extreme weather – to stop underwriting the new fossil fuel projects driving extreme weather in the first place.</li>
<li>Protecting animal welfare by asking companies to institute more humane policies such as eliminating gestation crates.</li>
<li>Pushing major retailers to phase out gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric lawn equipment to improve air quality and cut off another key contributor to climate change.<br />
A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-19277 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/appolinary-kalashnikova-WYGhTLym344-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>These are just some of the solutions we’ll be advancing this coming year to help build a cleaner, greener future today and for future generations. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.</p>
<p>Thank you for your investment in Green Century Funds, which makes our shareholder advocacy work possible.</p>

<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 860-822-3887</p>
<p><strong>Boston, April 25, 2023 –</strong> A notable 43% of restaurant company Bloomin’ Brands* shareholders voted in favor of Green Century Capital Management&#8217;s° shareholder proposal urging the company to set greenhouse gas reduction targets encompassing its supply chain emissions. Green Century had previously <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/thought-leadership/">secured a majority vote</a> on an emissions disclosure proposal at the restaurant parent company in 2021, but filed again due to what it viewed as insufficient progress.</p>
<p>“This is the third shareholder resolution we’ve filed with Bloomin’ Brands in four years,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/about-us/?gclid=CjwKCAjw0N6hBhAUEiwAXab-TWKBDG0nqSf-zKGCsqT7cpOnky5FLBfKRh7ozUex_S8YPL6cOCFX_BoCp8kQAvD_BwE">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Capital Management. “It is past time for the company to start taking investors’ climate concerns seriously. Climate change will affect every business, and this is especially true for food service companies like Bloomin’ that rely heavily on agricultural products.”</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008000;">Supply Chain Emissions a Concern</span></h2>
<p>Bloomin’ Brands is the parent company of Outback Steakhouse and Carrabba’s Italian Grill, among others, and operates more than <a href="https://www.bloominbrands.com/our-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1,450 restaurants worldwide</a>. Bloomin’s supply chain emissions, like that of other restaurant chains, likely represent over 90% of its overall emissions. Beef, which accounts for the majority of <a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/082d94f0-181a-4fe6-8bc8-00a59e0fac2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomin’s purchased </a><a href="https://investors.bloominbrands.com/static-files/082d94f0-181a-4fe6-8bc8-00a59e0fac2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proteins</a>, is one of the most potent <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-is-eating-meat-bad-for-the-environment/a-63595148#:~:text=With%2099.48%20kilograms%20of%20carbon,mutton%20production%20(39.72%20kilograms)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributors</a> to climate change globally and is responsible for 41% of tropical <a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deforestation</a>.</p>
<p>“Shareholders sent a clear message in 2021 that Bloomin’ Brands must address supply chain emissions, but we’re still waiting,” said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/">Douglass Guernsey</a>, Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management. “We look forward to seeing the company act on the strong shareholder support for this year’s proposal to set greenhouse gas reduction targets for its full supply chain.”</p>
<p>Climate change is directly driven by deforestation, which contributes nearly <a href="https://climatefundsupdate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CFF5-2019-ENG-DIGITAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12% of </a><a href="https://climatefundsupdate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CFF5-2019-ENG-DIGITAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human </a><a href="https://climatefundsupdate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CFF5-2019-ENG-DIGITAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Companies like Bloomin’ source beef, palm oil, soy and paper and pulp from locations with high risks of deforestation, like Brazil, where <a href="https://chainreactionresearch.com/report/cattle-driven-deforestation-a-major-risk-to-brazilian-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">land </a><a href="https://chainreactionresearch.com/report/cattle-driven-deforestation-a-major-risk-to-brazilian-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clearance </a><a href="https://chainreactionresearch.com/report/cattle-driven-deforestation-a-major-risk-to-brazilian-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for cattle</a> in particular is the primary driver of deforestation.</p>
<p>“Bloomin’ Brands can tackle two issues for the price of one by eliminating deforestation in its supply chain,” added <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/about-us/?gclid=CjwKCAjw0N6hBhAUEiwAXab-TWKBDG0nqSf-zKGCsqT7cpOnky5FLBfKRh7ozUex_S8YPL6cOCFX_BoCp8kQAvD_BwE">Guernsey</a>. “But the company must also set supply chain emissions reduction targets to start confronting these critical climate and deforestation risks.”</p>
