<p><strong>Boston, May 16, 2025</strong> – A Green Century° shareholder proposal requesting that Skyworks Solutions* disclose its full contribution to climate change received 21.9% of votes cast at the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday. The semiconductor manufacturer supplies major technology companies including Apple* , Google* and Microsoft* with materials that power billions of electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops.</p>



<p>“Investors need a more complete understanding of a business’ contribution and exposure to climate risk to understand potential effects on their investments,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“By disclosing the majority of its emissions, Skyworks would catch up to industry standards and meet investor expectations.”</p>



<p><strong>Skyworks lags competitors and customers on climate ambition</strong></p>



<p>The semiconductor industry accounted for <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as much climate pollution as half of U.S. households</a><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> combined</a><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2023</a>. About <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/a-plan-to-reduce-semiconductor-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% of a semiconductor’s climate footprint</a> comes from across its supply chain, including raw materials and device use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of Skyworks’ peers are reducing their impact on climate change. NXP Semiconductors* and Applied Materials* are among more than <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10,000 companies</a> that have set science-based climate emissions reduction targets. In addition, more than 60 semiconductor companies founded the <a href="https://www.semi.org/en/industry-groups/semiconductor-climate-consortium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semiconductor Climate Consortium</a> to mitigate emissions from the industry.</p>



<p>Skyworks’ largest customers also surpass the company in their climate commitments. Apple, which <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405602-skyworks-solutions-downgraded-at-argus-on-apple-worries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accounted for 69% of Skyworks’ net revenue</a> in 2024, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aims to be carbon neutral by 2030</a>, and other customers such as <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/climate-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> have equally ambitious targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Disclosing climate emissions increases transparency and drives action</strong></p>



<p>Measuring full value-chain emissions helps companies identify the largest sources of greenhouse gases across their operations and supply chain. It is also a crucial first step toward setting targets and implementing actions to reduce emissions.</p>



<p>Although Skyworks has disclosed its operational emissions and emissions from business travel, these are <a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely</a><a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> to account for less than 10%</a><a href="https://www.nxp.com/company/about-nxp/sustainability/environment-health-and-safety/emissions:EMISSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a>of the company’s overall impact on climate change based on competitors’ disclosures. <a href="https://www.appliedmaterials.com/eu/en/corporate-responsibility/planet/net-zero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peers that report a more complete emissions inventory</a> show that supply-chain and device use emissions typically comprise more than 90% of a semiconductor’s climate impact.</p>



<p>“Skyworks disclosing its full value-chain emissions would signal its intent to catch up to competitors and meet its customers’ expectations for climate action,” <strong>said Green Century </strong><strong>Shareholder Advocate </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/"><strong>Giovanna Eichner</strong></a>. “Continuing to trail the industry creates reputational, competitive, and climate risks that threaten its bottom line and the planet.”</p>
