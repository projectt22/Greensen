<p>A shareholder proposal co-filed by Green Century Capital Management called on Home Depot, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, to conduct a full assessment of its impact on nature and on the risks the company faces from the increasing instability of the natural environment. Company shareholders voted on the proposal at the company’s annual meeting Thursday. The proposal received 17% of votes cast, more than a similar proposal received at the company’s 2024 stockholder meeting.</p>



<p>“Home Depot sells lumber, paints, and herbicides, all of which adversely impact the environment, during either production or use,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.</strong> “The company has a responsibility to shareholders and the planet to account for how its business affects nature.”</p>



<p><strong>Investors concerned about the health of the natural world</strong></p>



<p>Climate change, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are stressing the planet. In this context, investors have begun asking companies to fully disclose how their operations, sourcing and sales impact the environment. More than 350 companies have committed to providing a comprehensive accounting of these actions under the <a href="https://tnfd.global/engage/tnfd-adopters-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure</a>.  The proposal co-filed by Green Century asks Home Depot to provide a similar assessment. The initiative was led by Domini Impact Investments and was also supported by Proxy Impact on behalf of the Great Oaks Fund.</p>



<p>University of British Columbia Prof <a href="https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/suzanne-simard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzanne Simard</a>, author of <em>Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest</em>, presented the proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. In her remarks, Simard, a professor of forest ecology, described the important role of forests in mitigating climate change and how industrial logging degrades the health of forests. Home Depot sources approximately 17% of its lumber <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/sites/default/files/2024-01/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the pristine Canadian boreal</a> forests. Studies have documented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">severe long-term damage</a> from forestry practices in the boreal and how the increasing rate and severity of wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/12/climate/canada-wildfires.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have hampered the forest’s ability to recover and regrow</a>.</p>



<p>“Home Depot needs to do a better job of taking care of the home we all share: Earth,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/andrew-shalit/"><strong>Andrew Shalit</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. </strong>“No one’s going to build a new deck when a wildfire’s burning in the back yard.”</p>

					<p><strong>Media Contacts:</strong></p>
<p>Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, <a href="mailto:asanders@greencentury.com">asanders@greencentury.com</a>, 773-272-6691</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boston, February 5, 2024</strong> – The Home Depot*, the world’s largest home improvement retailer, issued a new <a href="https://ir.homedepot.com/~/media/Files/H/HomeDepot-IR/2024/THD%20Sustainable%20Forestry%20Report%20-%20January%202024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainable forestry report</a> nearly two years after a related shareholder proposal from Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund based in Boston. The <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-majority-of-home-depot-shareholders-support-deforestation-shareholder-proposal-filed-by-green-century/">proposal</a>, which received <a href="https://www.governance-intelligence.com/shareholders-activism/home-depot-shareholders-back-deforestation-and-racial-equity-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64% of the shareholder vote</a> in May 2022, asked the company to assess how it could increase the scale, pace and rigor of its efforts to eliminate deforestation and forest degradation from its supply chains.</p>
<p>The report covers an in-depth assessment of the company’s wood sourcing policies and announces a set of strengthened standards that will protect high-risk regions such as the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/cerrado" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cerrado</a> in Brazil, the world&#8217;s most biodiverse savanna and home to 5% of the planet&#8217;s animals and plants. The report also asserts that the wood Home Depot sources from Canada is sustainable, sidestepping concerns that the company’s sourcing policies from the region contribute to degradation of the Canadian boreal forest.</p>
<p>“We applaud Home Depot’s new commitments that will protect more tropical ecosystems and the rich biodiversity our planet needs to thrive,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, President of Green Century Funds. “However, we believe the company’s Canadian sourcing policies fall short of the standards needed to protect the boreal forest, home to critical wildlife habitat for species such as grizzly bears and caribou.”</p>
<p>In the report, Home Depot announced an expansion of its approach to sustainable sourcing such that by the end of fiscal year 2026, wood products sourced to the U.S. and Canada from an additional set of high-risk regions will be required to bear third-party certification or be plantation-grown. The new policy covers a majority of Home Depot’s overall wood sourcing and includes regions such as the Cerrado, Gran Chaco, and Atlantic Forest biomes in South America.</p>
<p>“Home Depot’s new sustainable wood sourcing policies are a welcome step in the right direction,” said <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annie Sanders</a>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “We congratulate the company for establishing new protections in tropical ecosystems and urge additional steps to more fully protect primary forests in the Canadian boreal.”</p>
<p>The North American boreal forest is the largest intact ecosystem left on the planet. Disturbances from logging in the boreal forest have endangered <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/science/article-across-canada-caribou-are-on-the-edge-of-extinction-a-prominent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half</a> of the iconic woodland caribou herds. Unfortunately, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/04/world/canada/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new study</a> shows that logging in Canada’s boreal forest is causing severe damage, harming wildlife and compromising the forest’s ability to absorb and store carbon, which is critical for fighting climate change.</p>
