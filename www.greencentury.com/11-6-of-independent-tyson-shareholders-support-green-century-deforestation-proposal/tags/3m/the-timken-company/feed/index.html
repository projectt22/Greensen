<p><strong>Boston, May 2, 2025</strong> – A Green Century° shareholder proposal urging The Timken Company* to adopt science-based targets to reduce its climate emissions received 8.91% of votes cast at the company’s annual meeting on Friday. The Ohio-based steel bearing manufacturer is a key supplier for the global automotive, rail, renewable energy and agricultural industries.</p>



<p>“Timken needs to meaningfully address its negative impact on climate change, not just trim emissions from a small portion of its business,” <strong>said <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/">Leslie Samuelrich</a>, president of Green Century Funds. </strong>“Addressing climate emissions from its supply chain will help Timken meet the expectations of its customers and investors to mitigate climate-related risks.”</p>



<p>Like many companies with global operations, Timken’s supply chain may be increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. <a href="https://impact.economist.com/projects/trade-in-transition/climate_change/" data-type="link" data-id="https://impact.economist.com/projects/trade-in-transition/climate_change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The frequency of billion-dollar weather events</a> has increased from once every four months to once every three weeks in just a decade. These floods, hurricanes, droughts and other severe weather disrupt the manufacturing and transport activities that companies, including Timken, depend on to maintain profitability.</p>



<p>Green Century secured an agreement with Timken in 2021 that led to the company adopting its targets to cut climate emissions from its direct operations by <a href="https://investors.timken.com/financial-news/press-release/2023/Timken-Releases-Annual-CSR-Report-Provides-Update-on-2030-Emissions-Intensity-Target-Progress/default.aspx#:~:text=Announced%20in%202022%20and%20measured,than%20it%20did%20in%202018." target="_blank" rel="noopener">50% by 2030</a>. Despite making significant progress toward that goal, Timken hasn’t updated those targets to encompass its full value chain, which <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">represents the vast majority of its emissions</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Timken plays a critical role in the transition to renewable energy</strong></p>



<p>Timken is a major supplier for industries that are critical to reducing climate emissions. The solar and wind industries contributed more than 9% of its sales revenue in 2023, and its customers include companies such as BMW, Ford, and Mercedes, which <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/target-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have committed to major climate action</a>. As these customers seek to increase the sustainability of their supply chains, they will increasingly rely on suppliers reducing their own emissions.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Timken continues to be out of step with its peers and customers by failing to set science-based targets that would address its largest emissions sources, which may expose the company to not only the climate and transition risks of increasing emissions but also the competitive and reputational risks of remaining a laggard.</p>



<p>“Timken could bolster its image and position in the industry by committing to science-based climate targets across its full value chain,”<strong> said Green Century shareholder advocate <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.greencentury.com/team/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate/">Giovanna Eichner</a>. </strong>“Passing up the opportunity to become a leader in the renewable energy transition may heighten risks for Timken’s business and investors.”</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813</p>
<p>Pam Podger, <a href="mailto:ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 3, 2024</strong> – Twenty-two percent of shares were cast in favor of Green Century’s° proposal asking The Timken Company* (Timken) to establish emissions reduction targets that align with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C.</p>
<p>Timken set a 2022 goal to reduce its climate emissions by <a href="https://investors.timken.com/financial-news/press-release/2023/Timken-Releases-Annual-CSR-Report-Provides-Update-on-2030-Emissions-Intensity-Target-Progress/default.aspx#:~:text=Announced%20in%202022%20and%20measured,than%20it%20did%20in%202018." target="_blank" rel="noopener">50% by 2030</a>, but its target does not include indirect sources of emissions that typically comprise about <a href="http://chrome-extension:/bpconcjcammlapcogcnnelfmaeghhagj/edit.html" target="_blank">70 percent</a> of many companies’ climate emissions.</p>
<p>Further, Timken plans to cut carbon emissions per unit of revenue, which would allow it to generate more emissions if it earns more revenue. Because of that, its overall emissions reduction may be as little as 7% by 2030 or, worse, even increase.</p>
<p>“We’re looking for Timken to move from a laggard to a leadership position on climate and the clean energy transition,” said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. “We appreciate the investors who stood with us in asking the company to accelerate and expand its efforts to cut its carbon footprint ,and we invite more to keep the pressure on Timken.”</p>
<p><strong>Timken Flirting with Climate and Reputational Risk</strong></p>
<p>Timken, headquartered in Cleveland, manufactures tapered bearings made out of steel. Its products are used by many industries including food and beverage, marine vessels, mining, agriculture, construction, commercial vehicles, and renewable energy systems. As of 2023, the company employed more than 19,000 people in 45 countries.</p>
<p>Timken has been recognized as one of <a href="https://news.timken.com/2024-04-16-Timken-Recognized-by-Fortune-as-one-of-Americas-Most-Innovative-Companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">America&#8217;s Most Responsible Companies</a> by Newsweek, the World&#8217;s Most Ethical Companies® by Ethisphere, America&#8217;s Most Innovative Companies by Fortune and America&#8217;s Best Large Employers by Forbes.</p>
<p>Despite receiving multiple accolades, Timken is not fully addressing how its business contributes to climate change, which may hurt future profitability and make the company less attractive to investors. Companies with global operations and supply chains, like Timken, are <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vulnerable to a variety of climate impacts</a> ranging from droughts and floods to hurricanes. Therefore, we believe concerted efforts to achieve economy-wide emissions reductions are paramount.</p>
<p>Timken is a supplier to the wind and solar industry, which comprised over 9% of its sales in 2023. Many companies across industry sectors are scrutinizing the sustainability of their supply chains, and renewable energy developers are sensitive about sourcing from suppliers that aren’t reducing their carbon footprints. If Timken does not take steps to reduce its climate emissions, it may incur reputational damage as its clients and investors may call out its refusal to adopt meaningful emissions reduction targets.</p>
<p>“Nearly <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8,000 companies</a> have now set or committed to set emissions reduction targets through the Science Based Targets initiative, which supports the goals of the Paris agreement,” commented Andrea Ranger, shareholder advocate at Green Century. “By holding back, Timken is creating risk for investors, especially when bold climate action is required.”</p>

Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, aranger@greencentury.com, 781-249-2813<br />
Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, mmorgenstein@greencentury.com, 678-427-1671</p>
<p>BOSTON, November 10, 2022 &#8211; A year after Green Century° filed a shareholder proposal calling on The Timken Company (Timken) to adopt short-, medium- and long-term science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, the company has taken a strong first step toward fulfilling the proposal’s request. Timken has now adopted targets to reduce the intensity of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions (emissions from its direct operations) by 50% by 2030 in its manufacturing facilities with more than 100 employees. </p>
<p>An Ohio-based manufacturer of engineered steel bearings, Timken supplies critical components for the automotive, rail, renewable energy and agricultural industry sectors. In recent years, Timken has experienced double-digit revenue growth in the renewable energy market sector, where its bearings help wind turbine blades turn smoothly and help trackers that hold solar panels reliably follow the sun.  </p>
<p>“We are pleased with Timken’s new commitment to halve its emissions intensity in 8 years’ time,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Capital Management. “It’s a big first step for a company that had no greenhouse gas reduction targets just a year ago. We’re proud to have been a catalyst in its process.”</p>
<p>Timken’s announcement comes as its automotive customers, including BMW, Ford, Mercedes and Tesla, have all set or committed to set science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These commitments, made through the Science Based Targets initiative, mean that auto manufacturers are now accountable for reducing emissions from their full value chain. To meet their objectives, they will likely press suppliers such as Timken to cut their emissions in the not-too-distant future.<br />
“It’s interesting because Timken is part of this economy-wide transition to clean energy, and its products can be found in GE’s 14 MW Haliade-X, the world&#8217;s most powerful wind turbine, and in more than a third of the world’s utility-scale solar projects,” said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. But, Timken can’t just sell its products to renewable energy companies and pat itself on the back. It has to account for its own contributions to climate change, which is why we welcome its newly announced goal to cut its operational emissions.”  </p>
