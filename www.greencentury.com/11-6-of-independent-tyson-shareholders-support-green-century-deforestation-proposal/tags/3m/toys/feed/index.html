					<p><strong>Boston &#8211; </strong>Mattel, Inc.*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to report on its single-use plastic in packaging to the standardized reporting framework CDP in 2025 after reaching an agreement with <a href="http://www.greencentury.com">Green Century</a>°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>Mattel uses plastic packaging for its popular toy brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, and continues to develop ways to improve the sustainability of its packaging.</p>
<p>“We have tremendous respect for the team at Mattel and applaud the company’s commitment to transparency,” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Accurate data is critical for decision making, and this new commitment will let investors look ‘into the box’ to view how Mattel is reducing plastic waste.”</p>
<p>Mattel and Green Century had previously reached a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/statement-mattel-follows-through-on-plastic-reduction-commitment/">deal</a> in which Mattel agreed to set a company-wide plastic reduction goal. Mattel fulfilled that agreement in 2022 by committing to reduce its plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030.</p>
<p>This additional commitment to disclose information on single-use plastic in packaging to CDP will help stakeholders better understand Mattel’s sustainable packaging efforts through a recognized, standardized reporting platform.</p>
<h3><strong>Mattel to join 3,000 global companies reporting to CDP Plastic</strong></h3>
<p>Standardized reporting is an essential first step in reducing plastic pollution.</p>
<p>“Right now, each company discloses plastic information in different ways, making it nearly impossible for governments, recyclers, and investors to really know what plastic is out there,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “We really view CDP as the gold standard when it comes to voluntary disclosure.”</p>
<h3><strong>Plastic pollution continues explosive growth</strong></h3>
<p>The current plastic waste system has failed to keep plastic out of the ecosystem. Only <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/campaigns/beyond-plastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9% of plastic waste is recycled</a>, while plastic pollution has doubled every six years.</p>
<p>Plastic waste makes its way into waterways, killing marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, as plastic doesn’t break down like other materials, small particles of “<a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/updates/microplastics-in-100-of-the-co-waterways-we-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microplastics</a>” have been found in every environment and even the human bloodstream.</p>
<p>The issue has increasingly alarmed consumers and investors. Over <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/three-four-americans-support-national-policies-reduce-single-use-plastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75%</a> of respondents to a recent survey have asked companies to use less single-use plastic.</p>
<p>Companies’ efforts to improve sustainability of their products and packaging are an important aspect of helping to protect the planet for future generations.</p>

<p><strong>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Hasbro*, one of the largest toy companies in the world, has agreed to full disclosure of its plastic packaging use in 2024 after reaching an agreement with Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>
<p>The toy industry is by far the most plastic intensive consumer goods industry in the world.  Revealing plastic use, or disclosure, is a critical first step in reducing plastic pollution, which has nearly quadrupled in the past 20 years, and reducing material risks.</p>
<p>“With this commitment, Hasbro provides the transparency that investors want and need” said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Once Hasbro compiles its data, we encourage the company to use it to make stronger commitments to reduce its non-essential single-use plastic.”</p>
<h4><strong>Transparency is a first step towards sustainability</strong></h4>
<p>Plastic waste has passed the crisis stage. Plastic production has grown explosively in the past 60 years, with estimates predicting we will produce nearly 1480 million tons of plastic by 2050.</p>
<p>Of this, only 9% is likely to be recycled. In fact, plastic is more likely to be burned than recycled, with disastrous consequences for children living near incineration facilities. All other plastic results in waste that doesn’t degrade but breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics which pollute our oceans, soil, atmosphere and even our bloodstream.</p>
<p>Green Century has been engaging companies about their plastic use and waste for three years and has secured more than a dozen agreements with companies including Disney,* Costco,* and Mattel*.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, disclosure is about accountability and empowering consumers, managers and investors to make better decisions,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate</strong> with Green Century. “By improving transparency of its plastic use, Hasbro is positioning itself to be a more sustainable company.”<a href="http://www.greencentury.com"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-17909 size-medium" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png" alt="" width="300" height="88" /></a></p>

<p>Douglass Guernsey, Shareholder Advocate, dguernsey@greencentury.com, 617-747-4447</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, ppodger@greencentury.com, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>(Boston, MA)</strong> Good news for families looking to shrink their environmental impact this holiday season. Green Century°, one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds in the U.S., filed three shareholder resolutions asking toy companies Disney*, Hasbro* and Mattel* to cut single-use plastic. Not only is excessive plastic packaging unnecessary and wasteful, but toy companies could also increase long-term value by reducing risks from single-use plastics used to package toys.</p>
<p>“Some toys have more plastic packaging than actual toy – it doesn’t make sense fiscally or environmentally,” <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds</strong>. “There are real business concerns from single-use plastic, ranging from damaged brand reputation from plastic pollution to legal action because of toxicity. A toy&#8217;s packaging shouldn&#8217;t outlive the people who play with it.”</p>
<h5>It is estimated that American’s household waste increases by more than 25% from Thanksgiving to New Years. Much of this waste comes from plastic packaging.</h5>
<p>Excessive plastic packaging is highly visible and unpopular, and governments have increasingly issued taxes and bans on single-use plastic. Companies also face legal risk, as exemplified by New York state suing PepsiCo over river pollution and the multibillion-dollar fines leveled at manufacturers of plastic additive PFAS, commonly known as forever chemicals.</p>
<p>PFAS is one of the many chemicals manufacturers use in plastic packaging. This and other plastic additives, which are often largely unknown even to companies, are a particular concern for the toy industry as children are more susceptible to the effects of environmental toxins.</p>
<p>“Plastic is hurting wildlife in our oceans, and it&#8217;s also hurting us,” said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “Of the over 13,000 chemicals associated with plastics and plastic production, most have not been studied or are harmful to humans. Companies need to fully disclose their plastic footprints and commit to reducing all non-essential, single-use plastic.”</p>
<p>While investors are examining the growing issue, representatives from the UN are debating a global plastics treaty that could make companies responsible for the waste they create. Experts have stated that the best way to address the growing plastic crisis is to first reduce plastic use and production, particularly for non-essential single-use plastics, which are defined as plastics that are not absolutely necessary, have available alternatives, and have an intended lifespan of one use or less than 24 hours.</p>
