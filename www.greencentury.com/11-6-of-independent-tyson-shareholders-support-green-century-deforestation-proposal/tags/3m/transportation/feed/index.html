<p>As an investor in the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/balanced-fund/">Green Century Balanced Fund</a>, your money supports a green bond that helps improve the public transportation in the San Francisco region with the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) rail system.</p>



<p>BART’s green bonds, including this one held in the Green Century Balanced Fund, were among <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/RR%20Report%202024%20Spreads%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first public transit bonds in the country to be certified under the Climate Bonds Initiative’s Low Carbon Transport Standard</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bart.gov/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The accessible transit system</a> encourages people to stroll, bike or carpool to stations, sparks more centralized development for housing and shops, and helps create walkable communities that depend less on cars.</p>

<p>As of 2023, BART carried about 156,000 people on a typical weekday, resulting in the savings of about 31,000 gallons of gas and directly reducing CO2e emissions by more <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than 600,00 pounds per week.</a></p>



<p>For example, while a typical car gets about 23 miles per gallon, a BART rider gets the equivalent of 83 miles per gallon.</p>



<p>In an effort to reduce its carbon footprint, about 88 percent of BART’s contracted electric supply was greenhouse gas free.</p>

<p>Along with the system-wide improvements that included sustainably renovated stations, BART’s <a href="https://www.bart.gov/sustainability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new rail cars are electric and built of lightweight aluminum exterior to</a> cut energy use. The aluminum will also be recycled when the cars are retired. The cars also have white roofs to reflect heat and use LED lighting to save on energy costs.</p>



<p>The fixed income portion of Green Century’s Balanced Fund boasts more than 70% of green bonds. Many of these investments create clean or promote energy efficient transportation that offer an alternative to hundreds of cars on crowded city roads and auto pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Boston, August <span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">18</span>, 2022 – </strong>Green Century’s° shareholder proposal requesting AMERCO to adopt science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement goal went to a vote Thursday. The overall vote tally was 19% in favor of the proposal, which was crafted to boost AMERCO’s ambition to address climate change. However, excluding the nearly 50% of the shares controlled by employees and the family of company founders, the “aye” votes may have been closer to 66%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although AMERCO is a leader in the do-it-yourself moving business, boasting a sizable fleet of 186,000 light- and medium-duty vehicles available at 21,000 locations across all 50 U.S. states and 10 Canadian provinces, it is not a leader in quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions from its truck fleet and storage facilities. AMERCO has reported no plans to set emissions reduction targets, nor has it published any, even as the company’s largest institutional investors seek such targets and “quality plans to meet them.” &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich and Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger issued the following statements in response to the announcement of the majority vote:</strong></h2>



<p>“The investor support we received is nothing short of remarkable given that nearly 50% of the stock represents inside ownership,” said Samuelrich. “Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions has to be a priority to stabilize both the climate and the global economy. Emissions reductions are predicted to mitigate risks for AMERCO, too, by limiting extreme weather events that can interrupt customer travel and damage the U-Haul fleet and storage buildings.”</p>



<p>Ranger added, “AMERCO arose from humble beginnings in the 1940’s and built the beloved U-Haul brand that we know today. AMERCO has adapted and innovated since those early days. We believe it can continue to apply that innovative spirit by integrating key climate-friendly strategies from rolling out zero emission U-Haul vehicles to installing solar systems to power its facilities, all while wowing its customers and investors.”</p>
