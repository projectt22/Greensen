										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life as a shareholder advocate can be unpredictable – some of my work has a consistent flow, but I certainly wasn’t expecting an impromptu call from a CEO.</p>
<p>Green Century<em>°</em> shareholder advocates often use the stakes in different companies on behalf of Green Century Funds, as a way of influencing management decisions on deforestation, carbon emissions, climate change, single-use plastic reductions and other issues with environmental impacts. I work on our insurance campaign pressing insurance companies to stop offering coverage for new fossil fuel projects. Not surprisingly, these insurers are not interested in changing their insurance strategies.</p>
<p>During the year, shareholder advocates research the environmental risks that companies are exposed to or, worse yet, they create. And, we then communicate with companies by writing, calls, and face-to-face dialogue. When we can’t agree on a course of action, we present our concerns to fellow shareholders at companies’ annual meetings.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-17793 alignleft" src="https://www.greencentury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230524_080651-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>Fast forward to the Travelers’* annual meeting in Hartford, CT. After I presented Green Century’s Funds’ shareholder proposal, I went on a treasure hunt to meet the company’s board of directors and CEO, Alan Schnitzer. Security guards were blocking my path to the board, but I managed to meet three directors. I was thrilled.</p>
<p>I also asked to speak to Travelers’ CEO Alan Schnitzer, but he was busy. Then something special happened. As I reached my car to go home, Alan Schnitzer called me. I was sure it was a prank. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>We exchanged pleasantries, but the conversation steered toward Green Century Funds’ shareholder proposal. He wasn’t happy with it. We had to agree to disagree on whether insuring new fossil fuel projects was the right thing to do. Spoiler alert – I didn’t think it was. I still don’t.</p>
<p>A call from a CEO is a rare occurrence, and it signaled to me that Green Century Funds’ advocacy efforts were hitting their mark. However, I give a lot of credit to Travelers’ CEO for taking the time to call and listen to my concerns.</p>
<p>Being tenacious, and professionally polite, can pay big dividends. Further, the effort to meet board members helped humanize the relationship between Green Century Funds and Travelers. I’ll meet with Travelers again later this year, but now we have a stronger rapport.</p>
<p>It’s a privilege to be a shareholder advocate working on the toughest environmental challenges the world faces. Encounters with CEOs can result in better connections with corporate management. We always look for ways to collaborate, so we welcome phone calls from CEOs. Let’s work on solutions together.</p>
<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.</em></p>
<p>Warmly, Andrea</p>

<p>Andrea Ranger, Shareholder Advocate, <a href="mailto:aranger@greencentury.com">aranger@greencentury.com</a>, 781-349-2813;</p>
<p>Pam Podger, Communications Director, <a href="http://ppodger@greencentury.com">ppodger@greencentury.com</a>, 802-299-9495</p>
<p><strong>Boston, May 26, 2023</strong> – – Shareholders showed less support for a <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects/">Green Century° proposal</a> that asked Travelers to establish a deadline for phasing out underwriting new fossil fuel projects. Votes cast in favor reached <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000086312/000110465923064998/tm2316995d1_8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.8%</a>, less than the <a href="https://www.greencentury.com/votes-on-green-century-proposal-at-travelers-concludes-series-of-filings-at-major-insurers/">2022 vote outcome of 13.2%</a> for a similar Green Century proposal. Green Century filed the same proposal seeking underwriting restrictions on fossil fuel projects at a peer company, The Hartford*, earning 8.8% of the vote on May 17th.</p>
<p>Green Century’s proposals were prompted by concerns that Travelers’ underwriting strategies were not clearly aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Global climate and energy experts at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  and the International Energy Agency (IEA) assert that expanding fossil fuel supply will likely push the world beyond the recommended limit of a 1.5°C temperature rise. The IPCC reports explicitly that exceeding the 1.5°C limit will likely result in dangerous physical risks, and, in some cases, irreversible natural resource damage.</p>
<p>While U.S. insurers, <a href="https://about.chubb.com/citizenship/environment/coal-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chubb*</a> and <a href="https://newsroom.thehartford.com/newsroom-home/news-releases/news-releases-details/2019/The-Hartford-Announces-Its-Policy-On-Insuring-Investing-In-Coal-Tar-Sands/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hartford</a>, announced partial underwriting exclusions on insuring thermal coal mining and coal plant construction and operation in 2019, it took Travelers an extra two years to make a <a href="https://sustainability.travelers.com/iw-documents/sustainability/coal-tar-sands-policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar commitment</a>. Additionally, it has yet to extend its exclusions to contractors, equipment or projects that support the development of new oil and gas wells, pipelines, and related fossil fuel infrastructure, even as  climate experts declare the use of fossil fuels must dramatically decline.</p>
<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong> said: </strong></p>
<p>“Regardless of the vote, it&#8217;s important to keep this issue front and center for Travelers. We see no reason why it should enable new oil and gas supply in the face of the dire need to transition to a low-carbon economy.  To its credit, Travelers has already started down the right path by underwriting new renewable energy projects, including offshore wind construction. However, it still needs to detour from the path of insuring the expansion of fossil fuels.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/meet-our-team/"><strong>Andrea Ranger</strong></a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: </strong></p>
<p>“Covering the liability and casualty risks for owners, contractors, and equipment that will allow new methane gas, a.ka. “natural” gas, to flow or new oil for gasoline will only lock us into carbon emissions for years to come. In my view, Travelers has a duty not only to its shareholders, but to stakeholders in general, to pivot from an industry that’s contributed the most to climate change.”</p>
