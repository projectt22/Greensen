<p>Boston, June 5, 2025 – 5.8% of Walmart* shareholder votes were cast in favor of a Green Century° proposal urging the company to assess how it can increase the scale, pace and rigor of its sustainable packaging efforts. In part, the proposal urged Walmart to reduce its plastic packaging and ensure its recycling labels don’t mislead consumers.</p>



<p><br>“Plastic pollution is harming our oceans, our wildlife and our health,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>.. “Walmart’s investors have sent a message that the company cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution problem. It’s a material risk that concerns investors.”</p>



<p><br>The UN Environment Programme estimates that the social and environmental <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/42277/Plastic_pollution.pdf?sequence=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs of plastic pollution</a> are between $300 and 600 billion dollars per year. This includes costs to human health, the costs of ocean clean-ups and lost marine ecosystem services such as food production and recreation. Although recycling has often been elevated as the solution to global plastic pollution, experts agree it is reducing plastic use that is key.</p>



<p><br>Walmart set a <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/purpose/esgreport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goal to reduce its use of virgin plastic</a> in its private brand packaging by 15% by 2025 from 2020 levels, but as of 2023, its use of virgin plastic for private brand packaging had increased by 6%.</p>



<p><br>Studies show that consumers increasingly want to be offered products in reusable packaging, and that reusable packaging is one of the most <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/tipping-point-year-for-reusable-packaging-systems/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20United%20Nations,into%20the%20environment%20by%202040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">effective ways to reduce plastic pollution</a>. However, Walmart does not disclose information about reusable packaging initiatives in its <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/purpose/esgreport/environmental/waste-circular-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sustainability report</a>.</p>



<p><br>Beyond failing to disclose effective strategies to reduce its use of plastic packaging, Walmart uses labels with misleading recyclability claims on its plastic packaging, including the “Store Drop Off” label. According to investigations conducted by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-09-29/us-store-drop-off-plastic-recycling-often-ends-up-in-landfills?sref=Brs3FVmA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/abcnews.go.com/US/put-dozens-trackers-plastic-bags-recycling-trashed/story?id=99509422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABC</a>, the majority of plastic bags and films deposited in “Store Drop Off bins” are sent to landfills or incinerated, not recycled. As a result, some major brands such as <a href="https://www.mondelezinternational.com/snacking-made-right/esg-topics/recyclability-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mondelez</a> have publicly committed to stop using the “Store Drop Off” label while <a href="https://grist.org/accountability/amazon-says-its-plastic-packaging-can-be-recycled-an-investigation-finds-it-usually-isnt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other brands</a> have quietly stopped using it.</p>



<p><br>“Without action from companies such as Walmart, the impacts of plastic on our environment and the risks to human health will only increase,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century</strong>. “Investors understand this and have sent a clear message to Walmart: It is time to stop messing around with labels and reduce plastic pollution.”</p>

<p>Boston, May 2, 2025 &#8212; Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.* (KDP), the retailer of the leading single-serve coffee brewing system in the United States, has agreed to share more information about the recyclability of the plastic K-Cup pods used in its K-Cup brewing system. KDP made this commitment in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century°, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.</p>



<p><br>“Investing in more sustainable packaging is a commitment that consumers and investors are increasingly looking for,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/leslie-samuelrich/"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich</strong></a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds</strong>. “Given the reputational and legal risks associated with plastic packaging and misleading recycling labeling, Keurig Dr. Pepper should accelerate its transition to more sustainable options as soon as possible.”</p>



<p><br>KDP has agreed to provide consumers with information on whether their communities accept K-Cup pods for recycling. The company will also make it easier for readers of its sustainability report to understand what it classifies as recyclable. Finally, KDP has agreed to provide more information on the development of its K-Round system, which would make single-serve coffee in compostable, plant-based pods instead of plastic.</p>



<p><br><strong>What does it mean to be recyclable?</strong></p>



<p><br>According to the Federal Trade Commissions’ <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/federal_register_notices/guides-use-environmental-marketing-claims-green-guides/greenguidesfrn.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green Guides</a>, an item is recyclable if it can be “collected, separated, or otherwise recovered from the waste stream through an established recycling program for reuse or use in manufacturing or assembling another item.” In other words, a community must accept it for recycling collection and sufficient end markets must exist to turn the material into recycled plastic.</p>



<p><br>K-Cup pods are made from polypropylene, a material that <a href="https://recyclingpartnership.org/Polypropylene-Recycling-Coalition-Annual-Report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half of Americans can put in their curbside recycling bins</a>. However, far fewer communities accept these pods because they are hard to sort because they are so small. A <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/planet4-usa-stateless/2024/11/7287b658-gpus_finalreport_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Greenpeace report</a> found that only 1 out of the 375 material recovering facilities (MRF’s) included in the study accepted coffee pods made from polypropylene.</p>



<p><br>KDP has faced <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sec-keurig-dr-pepper-recyclability-settlement-coffee-k-pods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits</a> over its recyclability claims and was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fined by the SEC</a> for misleading shareholders about the recyclability of its K-Cup pods. California already regulates recyclability claims made by companies, and a <a href="https://calrecycle.ca.gov/wcs/recyclinglabels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new law</a> taking effect there in October 2026 that strengthens regulation of recyclability claims.</p>



<p><br>“We hope this move by KDP will make it easier for customers to access information on the recyclability of K-Cup pods in their communities,” <strong>said </strong><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/team/frances-fairhead-stanova/"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova</strong></a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century.</strong>. “We encourage the company to provide access to this information directly on its packaging.”</p>
