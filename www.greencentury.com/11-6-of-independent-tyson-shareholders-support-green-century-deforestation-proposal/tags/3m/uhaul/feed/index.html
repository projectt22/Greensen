<p><strong>Boston, August 11, 2022 – </strong>Green Century° has filed a shareholder proposal asking U-Haul’s parent company AMERCO to adopt science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement goal to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. The proposal goes to a vote at the company’s annual general meeting, which will be held in Phoenix at 9:00 a.m. PT on Aug. 18.</p>



<p>AMERCO owns and rents a sizable fleet of more than 176,000 light- and medium-duty vehicles. Despite the fact that the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gasses in the United States, the company has yet to do its part by setting greenhouse gas reduction targets or starting to transition its fleet to zero emission vehicles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger commented, “It’s remarkable that a company of AMERCO’s size and resources has yet to claim responsibility for the greenhouse gasses emitted by its rental trucks and vans. It should join the ranks of the more than 3,500 companies that have set or committed to set science-based targets inclusive of both their direct and indirect emissions.”</p>



<p>AMERCO peers continue to measure and eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Ryder and Public Storage publish their greenhouse gas emission metrics and reduction targets, and Ryder has set ambitious goals to reduce its Scope 1 emissions (i.e. direct emissions) by 10%, Scope 2 emissions (i.e. emissions from purchased energy such as electricity) by 30%, and Scope 3 (e.g. emissions from its leased trucks) by 15% by 2024. Additionally, Ryder has launched a pilot program for renting and leasing electric-powered vans.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>AMERCO’s Lack of Focus on Climate May Risk Alienating Millennial and Gen Z Customers</strong></h2>



<p>“Gen Z and millennials are demanding clean, green products and services,” stated Ranger. “AMERCO needs to make sure that its iconic U-Haul brand moving trucks, beloved by itinerant college students and 20-somethings making their way in the world, don’t get stigmatized as irresponsible sources of global warming emissions. AMERCO should take advantage of this opportunity.”</p>



<p>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich added, “We’re concerned that corporations are not doing enough to address the threat of climate change. In this instance, AMERCO’s well-regarded U-Haul brand may be vulnerable if it doesn’t make a speedy course correction and embrace a future of zero emission vehicles and buildings that run on 100% renewable energy. Without change, AMERCO customers, young or old, may just find another route to take for their moving and storage needs.”</p>
