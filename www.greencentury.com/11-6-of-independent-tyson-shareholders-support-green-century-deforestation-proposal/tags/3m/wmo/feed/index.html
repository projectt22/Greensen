<p><b>The first week of July, 2023 was the hottest week on record</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Meteorological Organization</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (WMO). This is following the hottest June on record. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WMO released a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Monday about monitoring potential new record temperature from massive heat waves across the U.S. and spanning several continents. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b></b></p>
<p><b>“We are in uncharted territory,”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said Christopher Hewitt, director of climate services at the WMO. “We can expect more records to fall … these impacts will extend into 2024. This is worrying news for the planet.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The erratic weather is linked to increasing levels of carbon pollution and climate change. We believe oil and gas companies knew that their products would create these problems but misled their shareholders and the public for years about the climate consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds, said the need to avoid fossil fuel investments is crucial and urged actions to help curb the effects of climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While fossil fuel executives reap the economic benefits of their reckless activities, every day people are left to deal with extreme heat or overflowing rivers due to weather made more extreme and erratic due to climate change,” said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. “Having your investments reflect your values is one way for us to take control and work for solutions.”</span></p>
