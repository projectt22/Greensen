<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders, Director of Shareholder Advocacy, </span><a href="mailto:asanders@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asanders@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 773-272-6691; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Morgenstein, Media Relations Director, </span><a href="mailto:mmorgenstein@greencentury.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mmorgenstein@greencentury.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 678-427-1671</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Boston, January 18, 2023</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Lowe’s Home Improvement*, the second-largest home improvement company in the United States, has issued a set of <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/sites/lowes-corp/files/2022-12/lowes-2022-forestry-report-12-28-22.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new industry-leading wood sourcing commitments</a> that will protect forests around the world. The new policies resulted from a report, prompted by </span><a href="https://www.greencentury.com/top-ten-green-century-highlights-from-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engagement with the Green Century Funds</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that assessed how Lowe’s could increase the scale, pace and rigor of its efforts to eliminate wood linked to deforestation and degradation of primary forests from its supply chains. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lowe’s has taken important steps toward protecting the forests it depends on for its business and the world depends on for a livable planet,” said </span><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/leslie-samuelrich/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leslie Samuelrich</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, president of the Green Century Funds. “Companies that buy and sell wood products must act now to address biodiversity and climate risks, and Lowe’s’ new commitments represent important steps in that effort.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><b>Lowe’s commitments will protect endangered wildlife</b></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s commitments entail a requirement that all its Canadian wood products be sourced from third-party certified forests by 2027. This is significant because the Canadian boreal contains 25% of the world’s intact forests as well as endangered boreal caribou and billions of migratory songbirds. Lowe’s also says it will “show preference” for wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which provides the </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/8/863" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most prescriptive and extensive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> environmental protection for forests. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We congratulate Lowe’s on far outpacing other large-scale home improvement retailers in the transparency and sustainability of their wood sourcing,” said </span><a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/people/annie-sanders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annie Sanders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowe’s has made a set of laudable commitments in response to investors, and we look forward to seeing the company’s continued efforts to address the protection of primary forests, which are undisturbed by industry and essential to biodiversity and the fight against climate change.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other key commitments outlined by the company include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment in reforestation projects in key sourcing regions to sequester carbon (trees capture carbon that would otherwise pollute the air) and help biodiversity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implementation of a grievance mechanism to provide stakeholders impacted by Lowe’s value chain a clear channel for sharing their concerns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a provision that encourages all vendors to engage in Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indigenous communities to determine which third parties, if any, are able to log on their land.</span></li>
</ul>
