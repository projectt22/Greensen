Google does not address the repairability of its devices when assessing their environmental impact. The company has also been known to lobby against legislation that would expand repair access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGiven the current regulatory landscape and growing interest from consumers, any company in the technology industry that is not embracing repair exposes itself to significant risk,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, president of Green Century Capital Management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission has said it will begin investigating companies thought to be illegally restricting repair access, and 27 states have considered repair legislation in the last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal is the second filed by Green Century this year aimed at reducing electronic waste and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the electronics industry. The first was filed with Apple* and was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">withdrawn<\/a> after the company announced a new DIY repair program, which will provide consumers with the resources necessary to perform common repairs to certain phone and laptop models. Microsoft* also announced in October that it will increase consumer options for device repair by the end of next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe urge Google to follow in the footsteps of industry peers like Apple and Microsoft and stop restricting repair,\u201d Samuelrich added.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
