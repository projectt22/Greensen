Last year, Green Century filed a similar proposal that garnered support from 35% of shareholders \u2013 the highest ever vote on an environmental proposal at the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe were disappointed with Amazon\u2019s lack of response following the significant show of support for last year\u2019s proposal,\u201d said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cWe believed we had no choice but to re-file.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Amazon does not disclose information about its plastic footprint, research has shown that the company is one of the largest corporate users of plastic packaging. A recent Oceana study found that the company\u2019s plastic waste has increased by one-third from 2019 to 2020 amid the influx of online ordering during the pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oceana also criticized Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/amsc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Second Chance<\/a> program, which is supposed to help customers recycle the company\u2019s packaging. This occurred after Oceana\u2019s staff found 41% of the stores Amazon claims to be participating in the program do not accept the e-commerce giant\u2019s plastic packaging for recycling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flexible plastic, which Amazon uses for many of its mailer envelopes, is not commonly curbside recyclable and, when released into the environment, has been found to be the deadliest type of plastic waste for marine animals like whales, dolphins, and turtles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century is a co-filer of the proposal. Sara Sackner is the lead filer, with support from As You Sow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
