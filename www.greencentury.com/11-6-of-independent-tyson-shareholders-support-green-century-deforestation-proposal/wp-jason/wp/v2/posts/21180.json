EMCOR designs and implements energy efficiency upgrades and constructs and services wind and solar energy installations. Further, during the COVID-19 pandemic, EMCOR has played a key public health role by improving and maintaining healthy indoor air quality in hospitals, educational facilities and office buildings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEMCOR had already taken steps to limit its greenhouse gas emissions, but we noticed that its goals were not yet aligned with the latest science. We reached out to see if the company would increase its ambitions,\u201d said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cWhen a company is receptive to investor concerns, direct engagement can reach the desired outcomes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to engaging with Green Century, EMCOR had already begun working internally to quantify its greenhouse gas emissions and increase the efficiency of its fleet and operations. In late December, EMCOR and Green Century came to a mutual agreement on emission reduction initiatives. Namely, by October 2022, EMCOR will submit a letter of commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative, which then gives the company two years to develop reduction targets that align with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commitment comes just after Green Century filed shareholder proposals with five other companies at the end of 2021 requesting they set emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, which validates greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and tracks their implementation for more than 2,000 companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis engagement with EMCOR is the type we like to see,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cTheir team really came to the table and listened to our concerns, and I think we both walked away satisfied.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
