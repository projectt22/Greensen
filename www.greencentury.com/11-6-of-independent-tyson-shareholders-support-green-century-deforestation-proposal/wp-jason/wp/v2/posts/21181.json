The chain is one of the largest in the world with franchises in more than 7,000 hotels worldwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of an agreement with Green Century, Choice Hotels will phase out single-use polystyrene products by the end of 2023 and transition to bulk amenities by the close of 2025 across its domestic brands. The polystyrene commitment excludes the Ascend Collection and the bulk amenity commitment excludes extended stay brands or the Ascend Collection. In its transition to bulk amenities, the company will replace miniature bottles of products like shampoo and conditioner with larger dispensers in order to reduce waste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe applaud Choice Hotels\u2019 commitment to reducing its impact on the plastic waste crisis and look forward to seeing the company implement its new goals in the coming years,\u201d said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century filed and then withdrew a shareholder proposal with the company in 2020. This announcement fulfills the withdrawal agreement reached by both parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Choice Hotels has not disclosed how the announcement will impact its plastic use, a similar transition to bulk toiletry dispensers across Marriott\u2019s* portfolio of hotels <a href=\"https:\/\/www.texarkanagazette.com\/news\/2019\/oct\/16\/major-hotels-make-move-bulk-size-toiletries-shift-\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resulted <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.texarkanagazette.com\/news\/2019\/oct\/16\/major-hotels-make-move-bulk-size-toiletries-shift-\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.texarkanagazette.com\/news\/2019\/oct\/16\/major-hotels-make-move-bulk-size-toiletries-shift-\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.texarkanagazette.com\/news\/2019\/oct\/16\/major-hotels-make-move-bulk-size-toiletries-shift-\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">% reduction in plastic use<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past year, New York <a href=\"https:\/\/www.euronews.com\/green\/2021\/05\/27\/mini-hotel-toiletries-will-be-illegal-in-new-york-from-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passed a law<\/a> banning miniature toiletry bottles from hotels starting in 2024.
