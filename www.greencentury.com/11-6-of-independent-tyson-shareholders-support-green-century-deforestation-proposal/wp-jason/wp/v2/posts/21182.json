A year after the filing, Corning has taken a significant step toward implementing Green Century\u2019s proposal by announcing its commitment to setting science-based targets with the Science Based Targets initiative \u2013 an organization representing the gold standard of corporate emissions reduction commitments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If approved and implemented, Corning would reduce its absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which result from its operations, by 30%, and its Scope 3 emissions, or emissions from its full value chain, by 17.5% by 2028. In concrete terms, that\u2019s the equivalent of growing 29,029,920 tree seedlings for 10 years or removing 54,545 cars off the road for the next seven years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCorning adds so much to our daily lives \u2013 from making the fiber optic cables that help us communicate to manufacturing the glass screens that protect our iPhones and iPads,\u201d said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cBy making this welcome announcement, they are committing to addressing climate change to their impressive list of work.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2006, Corning\u2019s Global Energy Management (GEM) teams have identified and implemented a variety of energy-saving measures at the company\u2019s global fiber and cable manufacturing facilities. They have installed LED lights and solar panels, optimized manufacturing equipment, and achieved process improvements. In addition, from 2014 to 2020, the GEM teams have saved the company at least $122 million.\u00a0 However, despite these efforts, Corning\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have grown by 62% from 2010 to 2017.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCorning\u2019s significant increase in emissions concerned us,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cHowever, the company\u2019s new commitment means it\u2019s heading in the right direction, and because electricity represents a majority of its operational emissions, Corning can continue to ramp up sourcing clean, renewable energy while rapidly reducing its carbon footprint. It\u2019s a win-win for Corning, its investors and the planet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
