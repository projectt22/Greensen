Chemours, a chemical company spun off from DuPont, also committed not to do business with Twin Pines or buy titanium from the Okefenokee-adjacent project at any time in the foreseeable future. Chemours announced a further commitment to \u201censure the value of the Okefenokee is maintained\u201d and made it clear that it has no plans to mine next to the refuge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe applaud Chemours\u2019 commitment to protect the Okefenokee,\u201d said Thomas Peterson, shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cChemours\u2019 decision to disavow any interest in the Twin Pines project sends an important signal: The leading company in the industry is stating that titanium mining next to the refuge is a non-starter.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">Green Century filed the proposal in November<\/a>, asking Chemours to address the serious risks that mining next to the Okefenokee would pose to the swamp\u2019s unique biodiversity, as well as the 95 million metric tons of carbon dioxide stored within its peat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Okefenokee is a critical habitat for many species as well as a major carbon sink. Maintaining the integrity of this ecosystem is of utmost importance,\u201d said Sister Mary Jean Sliwinski, provincial sustainability coordinator for the Felician Sisters of North America. \u201cThe Felician Sisters of North America are heartened by Chemours\u2019 decision to refrain from mining or purchasing any product that could be mined from this region. It is our hope that this commitment will encourage others in the industry to refrain from mining so close to this natural treasure.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century is withdrawing its shareholder proposal in exchange for the public announcement of Chemours\u2019 commitments to protect the Okefenokee. The company\u2019s action follows in the footsteps of DuPont, its corporate predecessor. DuPont abandoned a mining project next to the Okefenokee in the early 2000s, pledging instead to protect the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThese are the sorts of cases where big commitments about sustainability get tested and we learn whether corporate pledges on climate and biodiversity are to be trusted,\u201d said Ivan Frishberg, chief sustainability officer for Amalgamated Bank, which supported the engagement with Chemours. \u201cWe are very glad that Chemours has gone beyond requesting trust and is offering assurance that the Okefenokee is off limits.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 438,000 acres, the Okefenokee Swamp is one of the world\u2019s largest intact freshwater wetlands. More than 402,000 acres are protected in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the largest refuge in the eastern United States and home to hundreds of plant and animal species. Scientists have opined that the proposed Twin Pines mining project would lower the swamp\u2019s water level, causing serious damage to the ecology and wildlife habitat. This excavation would also dry out the swamp\u2019s peat beds to greater depths, promoting the spread of catastrophic fire, which would release enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chemours joins a long list of stakeholders committed to maintaining the Okefenokee\u2019s value. More than 100,000 public comments have been filed with the state and federal governments opposing the Twin Pines project, and over 100 religious leaders from around Georgia have declared their opposition, as have a bipartisan group of state and federal officials, including Bruce Babbitt, Interior Secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary under President George W. Bush. This widespread public opposition has received coverage in the <em>Washington Post <\/em>and many Georgia outlets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
