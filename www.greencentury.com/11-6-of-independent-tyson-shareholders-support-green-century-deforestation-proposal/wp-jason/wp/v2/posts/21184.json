Green Century co-lead filed the proposal with shareholder advocacy group As You Sow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coca-Cola has been named the world\u2019s top corporate plastic polluter for four years running. Investors believe refillables are an important strategy for Coca-Cola to diminish the amount of packaging that enters the environment from its products, as well as to reduce the reputational risk stemming from the company\u2019s association with plastic pollution. According to Coca-Cola\u2019s most recent World Without Waste report, refillables are also among the packaging options best suited to reduce the company\u2019s carbon footprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNot only are refillable bottles critical for combating the plastic pollution crisis, they are also deeply intertwined with Coca-Cola\u2019s history,\u201d said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century Capital Management. \u201cThe first ever bottle of Coke was a refillable one. It\u2019s time for the company to embrace its history by bringing this solution to a wider range of customers and making real strides toward reducing its plastic pollution.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coca-Cola already has a sizable refillable bottle footprint, which represents approximately 11% of its product packaging globally. Its refillable business makes up more than half of its sales in certain Latin American and African countries, but the company has yet to set a strategy for significantly expanding this type of operation on a global scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second proposal Green Century has filed with Coca-Cola regarding its plastic packaging footprint. The first was filed in 2020 and resulted in the company setting a goal to reduce its use of virgin plastic by 3 million metric tons by 2025, or the equivalent of 200,000 plastic bottles per minute for a year.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
