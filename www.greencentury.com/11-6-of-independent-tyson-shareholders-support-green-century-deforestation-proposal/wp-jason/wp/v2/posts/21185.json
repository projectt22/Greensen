It is the first known goal of its kind. Currently, reusable packaging accounts for 16% of the company\u2019s beverage portfolio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement comes after Green Century Capital Management<em>\u00b0<\/em> and As You Sow co-led the filing of a proposal urging the company to reduce its reliance on single-use plastic and increase its use of refillable and reusable packaging. The filers will assess in the coming days whether Thursday\u2019s announcement warrants withdrawal of the shareholder proposal.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable packaging is a critical solution to reducing plastic pollution, for which single-use items are a leading driver. This packaging is also associated with greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits, as Coca-Cola claims that reusable containers are among the best packaging options for the company to reduce its climate impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century, released the following statement:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith the plastic waste crisis escalating year over year, Coca-Cola\u2019s new goal is a welcome change in strategy for the world\u2019s biggest corporate plastic polluter. Refillables are the future, and Coca-Cola\u2019s leadership is essential in making this important change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe company acknowledged on this morning\u2019s earnings call that reusable packaging is critical for moving the world toward a circular economy and preventing waste. We congratulate the company on this new goal and hope that this commitment will result in a tangible reduction in Coca-Cola\u2019s contribution to plastic pollution.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the short term, we look forward to discussing the details with company representatives over the coming days.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
