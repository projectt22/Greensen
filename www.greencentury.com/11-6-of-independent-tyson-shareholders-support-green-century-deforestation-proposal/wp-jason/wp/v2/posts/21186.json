Independent shareholders include all shares that are not held by Tyson Limited Partnership or Tyson\u2019s directors or executive officers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyson uses significant amounts of hard-to-recycle plastic, such as polystyrene foam and flexible plastics like film and bags, yet the company does not report information about its packaging footprint to investors and has not set any goals around improving the sustainability of its packaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors are concerned that Tyson\u2019s lack of action on plastics could pose regulatory risk to the company. Plastics legislation such as extended producer responsibility laws, which would make producers like Tyson financially responsible for the disposal of their packaging, and minimum recycled content mandates have been passed over the last year in Maine, Oregon, Washington, Connecticut and New Jersey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Competitor Smithfield Foods recently set a goal to cut its use of virgin plastic in half by 2030. Other food companies and retailers, including Unilever, Mondelez, Target and Walmart, have set similar goals in the last few years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all shareholders, 13% supported the proposal. The support from independent shareholders is approximate and was calculated under the assumption that Tyson Limited Partnership and Tyson\u2019s directors and executive officers voted against the proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, president of Green Century Capital Management, issued the following statement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA meaningful percentage of independent shareholders have made it clear that Tyson needs to take plastic-related risks seriously. To borrow from the company\u2019s slogan, it\u2019s what their shareholders deserve. The company should heed investor concerns and begin developing a strategy to reduce its plastic packaging footprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTyson is simply way behind in the food industry when it comes to sustainable packaging. It\u2019s time for the company to catch up with industry standards, which have evolved greatly in recent years. This vote demonstrates investors\u2019 growing understanding of that evolution and that plastic packaging can pose a material risk to companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe will continue to urge leadership to take investor concern seriously and accelerate the company\u2019s progress toward packaging sustainability.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Other efforts with Tyson include:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">Green Century Withdraws Shareholder Proposal with Tyson Foods* After It Commits to No-Deforestation Policy<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">Green Century Capital Management Withdraws Tyson Foods* <\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">Shareholder Proposal Urging Progress on Plant-Based ProteinsTyson Foods* Faces Shareholder Pressure over Risks Associated with Animal Abuse<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
