This comes after Green Century\u00b0 and Clean Yield Asset Management filed a first-of-its-kind shareholder proposal in June pressing for these changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hain Celestial, a leading producer of organic and natural products, which has operations in North America, Europe and India, did not challenge the proposal. Instead, the company quickly agreed to Green Century and Clean Yield\u2019s request to ramp up its GHG reduction plans. In December, the corporation best known for its Celestial Seasoning tea products committed to adopting science-based targets by the end of 2023 and announced that it would source 100% renewable energy for its operations by 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt was remarkable how quickly Hain Celestial went from signing an agreement with us to committing to set science-based targets,\u201d said Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cBeyond that, the decision to double down and make a 100% renewable energy goal by 2025 was a welcomed surprise.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a recent study, food companies and their supply chains are responsible for nearly one-third of global GHG emissions \u2013 which includes everything from on-farm emissions to emissions from manufacturing fertilizer, transportation, food waste disposal and packaging. Supply chain and downstream greenhouse gas emissions, known as Scope 3 emissions, typically comprise a majority of companies\u2019 emissions. In Hain Celestial\u2019s case, it estimates that 91% of its total emissions are Scope 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHain Celestial is planning to take a big bite out of its emissions, which we appreciate,\u201d Ranger added. \u201cThat said, we plan to keep a close eye on its progress \u2013 after all, even though corporate ambition is very much needed, the proof is in the pudding.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Hain Celestial does successfully adopt a science-based target, it could eliminate at least 45% of its full value chain of emissions by 2030, which would be the equivalent of growing 13,678,569,814 tree seedlings for 10 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About Green Century Capital Management<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
