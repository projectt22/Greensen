Its effort is a step further than other retailers, such as Target and Walmart, who have set goals to reduce the amount of virgin or new plastic used in packaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cODP\u2019s noteworthy commitment positions the company as a leader in the retail industry for mitigating plastic-related risks,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management. \u201cAs they set their goals to reduce plastics, they will be \u2018taking care of business,\u2019 as their slogan states, and we look forward to working with them as they do their part to reduce the unnecessary use of plastics.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this announcement, ODP will soon join ranks with companies like Unilever and Conagra who are working to eliminate portions of plastic from their packaging portfolios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plastic pollution, which has now been found from the peak of Mt. Everest to ice in Antarctica, is expected to grow from 11 million metric tons per year in 2016 to 29 million metric tons per year by 2040. According to a study from the Pew Charitable Trust, current commitments from government and industry will only stem plastic pollution by 7% by 2040. Corporations must reduce their demand for plastic by one-third by 2040 in order to avoid worsening the already dire plastic pollution crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
