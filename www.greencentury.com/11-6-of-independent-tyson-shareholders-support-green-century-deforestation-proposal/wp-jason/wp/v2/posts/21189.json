Major insurance companies like AIG* are also ruling out investing in or providing insurance cover for Arctic energy exploration. Chevron should similarly steer clear of any future projects in the refuge.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chevron, which has recently come under scrutiny for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2022\/02\/16\/1081119920\/greenwashing-oil-companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">failing to follow through on its climate pledges<\/a>, declared its support for drilling in the Arctic Refuge at its 2020 annual shareholder meeting. The company has demonstrated long-standing interest in the region, having partnered with BP* to complete the only test well ever drilled in the Arctic Refuge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/news\/\">Green Century filed a similar shareholder proposal last year<\/a>, calling on the company to renounce drilling in the Arctic. Chevron refused. Instead, the company attempted to block its shareholders from considering the proposal. It petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow exclusion of Green Century\u2019s proposal from its proxy statement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Chevron did not bid at the initial Arctic Refuge lease sale last January, the Journal of Petroleum Technology noted in October 2021 that Chevron does not appear to be \u201cleaving the scene anytime soon,\u201d in reference to Alaska\u2019s North Slope. Green Century is therefore once again calling on the company to make a commitment not to pursue drilling in the Arctic Refuge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bureau of Land Management calculated that burning all the oil in the Arctic Refuge would release more than 4.3 gigatons of CO2e. That\u2019s the equivalent of 94% of all U.S. emissions from energy consumption in 2020. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the calving ground of the Porcupine caribou herd as well as more than 200 bird species, 42 species of fish, and 45 mammals, including four threatened species that are protected under the Endangered Species Act. It is unsurprising then that the prospect of drilling in the Arctic Refuge is wildly unpopular \u2013 more than two-thirds of Americans oppose oil and gas development in this special place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
