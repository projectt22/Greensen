In addition to being the highest ever shareholder vote in favor of a plastics or packaging proposal, the vote is the highest ever recorded on an E&amp;S shareholder proposal that was opposed by management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen investors demonstrate concern for packaging-related risks at this scale before,\u201d said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cThe result is truly remarkable and sends an indisputable message to leadership: Jack in the Box must address the environmental impacts of its packaging footprint.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This overwhelming show of support from investors comes at a time of growing momentum for addressing plastic pollution. Last week, the United Nations Environment Assembly announced a historic resolution to develop a global legally binding treaty for addressing the plastic pollution crisis. Last month, Green Century and shareholder advocacy group As You Sow withdrew a shareholder proposal with Coca-Cola* after the company announced a goal to reach 25% reusable or refillable packaging across its beverage portfolio by 2030.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to such competitors as McDonald\u2019s,* Burger King* and Taco Bell,* Jack in the Box currently has no goals aimed at improving the sustainability of its packaging. The company also does not report more broadly on environmental sustainability efforts on its website, which may have raised a red flag among institutional investors that increasingly view sustainability reporting as standard practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe believe this vote should serve as a wake-up call, not only for Jack in the Box, but also for any company that has pushed their sustainability efforts to the back burner,\u201d Tarizzo added. \u201cInvestors have proven that they will turn out in droves if they feel a company is not taking material environmental risks seriously enough.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately 11 million metric tons of plastic waste pollute the ocean each year, and microplastics have been found everywhere from the top of Mt. Everest to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. Emissions from plastic production are also expected to outpace those from U.S. coal plants by 2030. Fiber-based packaging can drive deforestation and forest degradation and its production is associated with high water usage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
