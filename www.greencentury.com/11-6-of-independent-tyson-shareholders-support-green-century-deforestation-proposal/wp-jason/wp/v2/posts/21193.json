In an accompanying <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dell.com\/en-us\/blog\/repair-reuse-recycle-the-circular-economy-in-action\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post<\/a>, the company highlights its definition of repairability and notes its longstanding support of its \u201ccustomers\u2019 choice to repair their own device.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Dell has long provided customers and independent repair shops with access to such repair resources as manuals and replacement parts, the company had never directly articulated its support for product repair choices. Given the growing momentum of the Right to Repair movement and increasing attention from regulators and legislators on the issue of manufacturers restricting repair to their own authorized servicers, investors wanted assurance that Dell is prepared to continue its industry-leading efforts to make product repair accessible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are pleased to see Dell take a more explicit position on its efforts to enable product repair,\u201d said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cWe believe that remaining actively engaged in the Right to Repair conversation is critical for technology companies, from both a reputational and a regulatory perspective.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last year, Right to Repair legislation has been introduced in 27 states and in the U.S. Congress. In July, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing the Federal Trade Commission to develop rules on \u201cunfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the company leads industry peers like Apple* and Alphabet\u2019s* Google on repair accessibility, investors remain concerned about Dell\u2019s affiliation with industry trade groups such as TechNet and the Consumer Technology Association, which routinely lobby against Right to Repair reforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEven industry leaders have room for improvement,\u201d Tarizzo added. \u201cWe urge Dell to distance itself from trade groups whose lobbying activities run counter to its position on product repair.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
