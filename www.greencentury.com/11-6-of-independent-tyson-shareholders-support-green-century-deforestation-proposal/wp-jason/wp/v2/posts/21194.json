The company also pledged to report on how it is operationalizing its <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.lowes.com\/our-responsibilities\/corporate-responsibility-reports-policies\/lowes-wood-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wood Sourcing Policy<\/a>, which includes pledges to avoid high conservation value forests and wood from the habitat of threatened species. Lowe\u2019s is one of the world&#8217;s largest home improvement retailers and a major purchaser of wood products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn evaluating an end to sourcing from primary forests, Lowe\u2019s has taken an important step toward addressing deforestation risk,\u201d said Thomas Peterson, shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cIf we are to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and mitigate biodiversity collapse, companies that buy and sell wood products must take action to stop sourcing from primary forests, which are among the most carbon-dense and ecologically significant places on Earth.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As requested in Green Century\u2019s shareholder proposal, Lowe\u2019s has agreed to produce a report to assess how it might eliminate deforestation and primary forest degradation. The company has also committed to exploring a requirement that suppliers obtain Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) from indigenous communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Lowe\u2019s recently announced plans to <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.lowes.com\/newsroom\/stories\/fresh-thinking\/lowes-science-based-net-zero-target-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set science-based net zero emissions targets this year<\/a>. These targets will cover emissions from Lowe\u2019s supply chain, including forestry-related emissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deforestation and primary forest degradation are responsible for approximately 13% of global greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to biodiversity loss. Roughly 90% of Lowe\u2019s wood comes from North America, including from Canada\u2019s boreal forest. Boreal forests harbor significant biodiversity and are critical carbon storehouses, holding approximately a third of all terrestrial carbon. Canada\u2019s boreal, which constitutes 25% of the world\u2019s remaining intact forest and stores twice as much carbon per hectare as tropical forests, experiences the third-highest rate of intact forest loss globally, releasing tens of millions of metric tons of carbon annually. Demand for wood products is a primary driver of industrial clearcutting in Canada.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century\u2019s engagement with Lowe\u2019s follows our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">landmark shareholder proposal with Procter &amp; Gamble*<\/a>, which earned a majority shareholder vote in fall 2020 and called on the company to take action on deforestation and forest degradation, with a focus on wood pulp sourcing from Canada\u2019s boreal forest. Since that majority vote, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">Procter &amp; Gamble has improved its deforestation policies, but has stopped short of ending sourcing from primary forests<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
