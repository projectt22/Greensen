This came after the company committed to reducing the impact of its plastic packaging use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the withdrawal agreement it signed with Green Century, Newell committed to setting a goal to achieve at least 20% non-virgin plastic packaging for the manufactured goods portion of its product portfolio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company will also begin an assessment of the packaging materials used across the sourced finished goods portion of its product portfolio so that it can expand its focus on sustainable packaging to more of its products. Newell intends to eliminate unnecessary packaging components and transition away from plastics where possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPlastic packaging can pose material risks to companies, so we are pleased to see Newell take this step toward reducing the impact of its plastic use,\u201d said Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cWe encourage the company to take its efforts a step farther in the future by setting a measurable goal for absolute plastic reduction.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This effort was recently announced in Newell\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/newell.brightspotcdn.com\/bf\/39\/2f16a54b400db56dd2a53d317ff3\/newell-ccr-report-2021-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2021 Corporate Citizenship Report<\/a>. Manufactured goods refers to products made by Newell, while sourced finished goods are produced by third-party manufacturers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 11 million metric tons of plastic pollute the ocean every year, and if plastic production is not significantly curtailed, annual pollution could reach 29 million metric tons by 2040. Polluted plastics kill more than 1 million marine animals every year and may be inhibiting the ocean\u2019s ability to sequester carbon, an ecosystem service critical to meeting the world\u2019s climate goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
