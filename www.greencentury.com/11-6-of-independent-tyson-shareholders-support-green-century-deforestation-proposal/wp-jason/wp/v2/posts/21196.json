The proposal requires disclosure of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which constitute emissions from a company\u2019s operations and purchased energy, and, for some companies, Scope 3 emissions, or emissions associated with a company\u2019s supply chain and the use of its products. The proposed rules will be subject to a public comment period before they are finalized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Green Century\u00b0 president Leslie Samuelrich issued the following statement:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe SEC\u2019s proposed requirement that companies disclose their greenhouse gas emissions represents a major step forward. We believe climate vulnerabilities and value chain emissions constitute material information, and investors need reliable, comparable disclosures in order to assess issuers\u2019 exposure to physical and transition risk. These SEC rules will ensure companies provide that critical disclosure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe applaud the SEC for including a phased-in requirement that large companies disclose scope 3 emissions when these emissions are material or when the company has scope 3 emissions targets. Scope 3 emissions represent the vast majority of the climate impact of companies in many sectors, from fossil fuels, to retail, to consumer packaged goods. Investors need these disclosures in order to understand a company\u2019s true exposure to climate risk, and to evaluate whether companies are authentically reducing the emissions associated with their value chains. As our shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/climate-disclosure-poses-thorny-questions-for-sec-as-rules-weighed-11645180200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told the Wall Street Journal last month<\/a>, the exclusion of scope 3 emissions disclosure would have incentivized companies to shift emissions to their suppliers or customers to give the impression of emissions reduction, while value chain emissions actually grew or remained static. Some of the world\u2019s largest polluters have vastly underreported and misrepresented their emissions by excluding scope 3. The SEC is closing the door on that kind of greenwashing.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
