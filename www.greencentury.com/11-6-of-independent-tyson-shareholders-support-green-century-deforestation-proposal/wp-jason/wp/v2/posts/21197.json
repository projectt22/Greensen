This is the first-ever shareholder proposal to go to a vote that asks an insurance company to cease underwriting new fossil fuel supplies in alignment with the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) <em>Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t overstate the importance of today\u2019s SEC ruling,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger<\/a>, shareholder advocate with Green Century.&nbsp; \u201cWe can now ask insurance companies to adopt policies that align with the IEA report findings, which we believe makes clear that fossil fuel expansion has no place in a net zero by 2050 future. Insurers like Chubb have enabled the fossil fuel industry to continue business-as-usual which has delayed much-needed adoption of clean energy technologies.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ruling follows a policy sea change at the SEC on climate issues. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">In November, the commission announced in a legal bulletin that it would allow shareholders more leeway to ask companies to address climate change and its associated risks<\/a>. The SEC\u2019s new guidance provides shareholders more influence on the management of climate-related risks and may signal that similar shareholder proposals are poised to survive challenges at the SEC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chubb claimed that Green Century\u2019s proposal would interfere with the company\u2019s ability to run its day-to-day business. But reflecting its November guidelines, the SEC affirmed the shareholder right to press companies on broad societal issues such as climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the SEC\u2019s ruling, the similar proposals that Green Century filed with Travelers* and The Hartford* may also go to the ballot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m elated that our proposal will go to vote,\u201d Ranger said. \u201cInsurers have been saying that underwriting fossil fuels, even new fossil fuel projects, requires a careful, calculated approach. We agree, but they should have started the process years ago. Even the current geo-political conflicts demonstrate how politically charged and risky fossil fuels are, and, in our opinion, is another reason for insurers to walk away.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
