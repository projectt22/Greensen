Green Century\u2019s&nbsp;proposal urged Alphabet to make repairing its products more accessible to consumers and independent repair shops.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re glad to see Google join the Right to Repair movement and catch up with its industry peers by announcing this new initiative,\u201d said Green Century Capital Management President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement underscores consumer demand for repair options, the wave of change in the tech industry around product repair, and the power of shareholders.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The replacement parts will be available for sale through iFixit, an online repair guide provider and Right to Repair advocate, and will cover models from the Pixel 2 through the Pixel 6 Pro, as well as future models. The announcement is a striking reversal for the company, which has long lobbied against Right to Repair reforms and employed policies that make repairing its products difficult.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAccess to spare parts is a critical component of Right to Repair,\u201d Samuelrich said. \u201cIt helps companies like Alphabet mitigate risk by keeping electronic waste from smartphones out of the landfill, fulfilling consumer expectations for more repair options, and preparing for potential regulatory requirements at both the state and federal level, especially in light of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s recent statements on this issue.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alphabet\u2019s announcement comes in the wake of similar ones made in the last year by Apple,* Microsoft,* and Samsung,* which have all committed to increasing repair accessibility for the devices they sell. Apple\u2019s announcement was similarly prompted by a Green Century shareholder proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making replacement parts more widely available is key to the Right to Repair and provides numerous environmental benefits by keeping devices in use for longer periods of time, such as reducing toxic electronic waste and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the manufacturing process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a positive development, and we encourage the company to expand its spare part offerings to all of its devices, including for its Nest Thermostats, and making a formal commitment to stop lobbying against Right to Repair reforms,\u201d Samuelrich said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
