The company neither publishes a sustainability report nor discloses any of its operational or value chain emissions. And rather than planning for a transition to a future of low-emission vehicles, AMERCO views them as a threat to its business model.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Setting Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets Could Help U-Haul Transition to a Low-Carbon Economy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe firmly believe that adopting science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets will help AMERCO prepare for and transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cU-Haul is such a well-respected brand, but it needs goals that lead to where its customers want it to go \u2013 to a climate-friendly destination.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, AMERCO\u2019s peers are out-performing the company in regard to their sustainability strategies. For example, Ryder has set and accomplished goals to reduce emissions from its direct operations. Now, it\u2019s increasing its ambition by setting targets to reduce its indirect emissions (such as from customer use of its rental trucks). Ryder has a goal of reducing these customer-related emissions 15% by 2024. To meet that goal, Ryder has started to offer zero emission vehicles for rent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the United States, and emissions from trucks alone comprise a staggering 82% of that total. AMERCO itself is among the top three truck rental companies in the U.S. owning a fleet of more than 176,000 light- and medium-duty vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAMERCO\u2019s transportation footprint is significant,\u201d Ranger noted. \u201cInvestors, and increasingly consumers, are looking to companies to proactively scale back their emissions. Setting rigorous science-based targets and zero emission vehicle goals is a way to signal that intent.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
