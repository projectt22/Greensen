CVS is the largest pharmacy chain in the United States and ranks fourth on the Fortune 500.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe applaud CVS for taking its plastic-related risks seriously and are encouraged that one the largest companies in the country will reduce its plastic use,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management. \u201cCorporate goal-setting to stem production of new plastics is crucial for protecting wildlife in our oceans, reducing waste in our landfills and safeguarding human health.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the virgin plastic reduction goal, the company announced plans to eliminate problematic and unnecessary plastics from its store brand packaging by 2030. CVS has also agreed to disclose plastic footprint metrics for most of its store-brand packaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plastic Reduction Mitigates Competitive, Environmental and Human Health Risks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This announcement makes CVS a leader on its plastic packaging efforts, surpassing such retailers as Walgreens,* which has a goal to reduce plastics in its U.S.-owned brand packaging by 30% by 2030, and Target,* which plans to reduce virgin plastic use in its owned brand products by 20% by 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plastic pollution is anticipated to grow from 11 million metric tons annually to 29 million by 2040, which will have adverse impacts on wildlife and ocean health. Plastic also poses risks to human health. In fact, recently released studies found microplastics in both human lungs and bloodstreams. In order to keep the plastic pollution crisis under control, companies must reduce their plastic demand by one third by 2040.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
