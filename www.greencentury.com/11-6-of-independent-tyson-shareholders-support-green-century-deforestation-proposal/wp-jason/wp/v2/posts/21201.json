To do that, we must stop the flow of finance to companies that destroy forests,\u201d said Green Century president Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cCiti\u2019s commitment to expanding its forest protection policies is especially significant, as the bank is among the largest financiers of some of the top sectors abetting deforestation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citi\u2019s new commitments will apply to those industries that are responsible for the majority of tropical deforestation: soy, beef, palm oil and forestry. In exchange for the withdrawal of Green Century\u2019s shareholder proposal, Citi has agreed to adopt no-deforestation standards for soy clients operating in high-risk regions, develop a no-deforestation approach for high-risk beef clients, and improve its existing standards for palm oil and forestry clients to align with best practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBanks like Citi cannot credibly achieve their publicly-stated net zero emissions goals without ending financing for companies that drive deforestation,\u201d said Green Century shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson. \u201cWith these new commitments, Citi will become the leading U.S. bank when it comes to addressing deforestation exposure in its financing. That\u2019s an important step toward Citi aligning its forest policies with its climate ambitions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This commitment from Citi builds on a landmark agreement that Green Century secured <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">with JPMorgan Chase<\/a>* last year, when JPMorgan became the first American bank to require its palm oil clients to adopt \u201cNo Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation\u201d (NDPE) policies. Citi will align with this NDPE policy and expand its scope, while also surpassing JPMorgan with improved forestry sector standards \u2013 notably requiring best-practice Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification for clients in tropical forests \u2013 and with a no-deforestation approach for beef clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First Affirmative Financial Network co-filed the Citi proposal with Green Century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhile Citi still has work to do to ensure that its clients are not driving deforestation, we are encouraged by the steps that the bank is taking to address these risks,\u201d said Holly Testa, Director of Shareowner Engagement for First Affirmative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deforestation is responsible for approximately 15% of global emissions, making it the second leading cause of climate change. In addition to exacerbating the climate crisis, deforestation accelerates biodiversity loss, undermines healthy ecosystems, and plays an active role in the spread of infectious diseases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fao.org\/3\/ca8642en\/ca8642en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UN Food and Agriculture Organization<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fao.org\/3\/ca8642en\/ca8642en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">declared<\/a> that deforestation and forest degradation are taking place at \u201calarming rates.\u201d A total of 1,621,629 square miles of forest, an area larger than India, has been cleared since 1990, mostly for agricultural expansion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p>Green Century Capital Management is one of the foremost North American investors engaging companies on risks related to deforestation. Green Century has worked with dozens of corporations to mitigate their exposure to forest-related risks and secured some of the earliest corporate no-deforestation commitments.
