U.S.-based consumers can now access repair manuals and purchase more than 200 parts and tools for fixing iPhone 12, 13, and SE 3 models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement of the program was a reversal in course for Apple, which has historically opposed the Right to Repair. While there are promising aspects, particularly the free availability of repair manuals, investors have remaining concerns about how the program will be run and how Apple is still maintaining tight control over the repair of its products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike similar initiatives announced by Google and Samsung, Apple is requiring consumers to pair replacement parts to the serial number of the device being repaired. This will continue to make it difficult for independent repair shops to perform iPhone repairs and will pose challenges to refurbishers who want to repair phones after Apple stops officially supporting the model. As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/News\/59239\/apples-self-repair-vision-is-here-and-its-got-a-catch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noted <\/a>by repair organization iFixit, this \u201cessentially puts an expiration date on iPhones.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Annalisa Tarizzo, shareholder advocate with Green Century Capital Management,<em>\u00b0<\/em> released the following statement<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe launch of Apple\u2019s repair program today is a promising step forward for the company and should provide some comfort to investors that Apple is working to mitigate the regulatory risks posed by potential Right to Repair regulations from the Federal Trade Commission and state legislatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, this program does not sufficiently address our concerns related to the reputational and environmental risks posed by the electronic waste and greenhouse gas emissions associated with premature device disposal. Apple should take steps to eliminate the \u2018parts pairing\u2019 element of the program to ensure company devices can reach their full lifespan potential.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
