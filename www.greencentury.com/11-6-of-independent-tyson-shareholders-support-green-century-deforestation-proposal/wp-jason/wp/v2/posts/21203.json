The company, which makes a wide array of popular toys from Barbie dolls to Hot Wheels cars, <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.mattel.com\/news\/mattel-announces-goal-to-reduce-plastic-packaging-by-25-per-product-by-2030-and-publishes-latest-citizenship-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced <\/a>a new goal to reduce plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030, after reaching an agreement last year with Green Century for the environmentally responsible fund to withdraw a shareholder proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mattel has already increased its disclosure about packaging materials as part of this agreement, reporting on how much recycled content it uses in its <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.mattel.com\/content\/dam\/corp-site\/pdfs\/Mattel-2020-Citizenship-Report-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2020 <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.mattel.com\/content\/dam\/corp-site\/pdfs\/Mattel-2020-Citizenship-Report-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Citizenship <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.mattel.com\/content\/dam\/corp-site\/pdfs\/Mattel-2020-Citizenship-Report-FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Report<\/a>. With this new goal, Mattel is aligning itself with some of its competitors in the toy industry, such as Hasbro, which has pledged to eliminate plastic in all new product packaging by the end of this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plastic pollution in the ocean is projected to increase significantly in the coming decades, with some estimates predicting a rise to 29 million tons annually by 2040. The UN Environment Programme has classified the toy industry as <a href=\"https:\/\/wedocs.unep.org\/bitstream\/handle\/20.500.11822\/9238\/-Valuing%20plastic%3a%20the%20business%20case%20for%20measuring%2c%20managing%20and%20disclosing%20plastic%20use%20in%20the%20consumer%20goods%20industry-2014Valuing%20plasticsF.pdf?sequence=8&amp;isAllowed=y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the most plastic-intensive<\/a> in the world, making it all the more important that toy companies assess their plastic use and related risks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management, released the following statement<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even realize how much plastic comes with a toy until you see the mess left behind at a child\u2019s birthday party or during the holiday season. Kudos to Mattel for addressing its role in the toy industry\u2019s plastic packaging problem. Mattel\u2019s new goal is particularly important because it addresses the company\u2019s total plastic use, not just reducing new plastic in favor of recycled material.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is a step forward in having children enjoy their favorite toys without parents dealing with unnecessary plastic packaging. Making outright cuts to plastic use is critical for addressing plastic pollution\u2019s impacts on wildlife and the climate, and we encourage more companies to follow in Mattel\u2019s footsteps.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
