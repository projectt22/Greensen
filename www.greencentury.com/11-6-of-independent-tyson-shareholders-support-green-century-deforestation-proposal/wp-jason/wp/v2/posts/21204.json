Greenhouse gas emissions from the food system represent roughly a third of all planet-warming emissions. Kroger is the largest supermarket chain in the United States, and among the nation\u2019s largest general retailers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFrom clearing rainforests for agriculture, to raising livestock, to transporting food from farms on one continent to stores on another, our food system generates significant planet-warming emissions,\u201d said Green Century president Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. If other large food retailers follow Kroger\u2019s lead in reducing their supply chain emissions, it could galvanize a shift toward sustainable agriculture.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century\u2019s shareholder proposal to Kroger called on the grocery chain to set science-based emissions reduction targets for its scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions that would lead to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those from a company\u2019s operations and purchased energy, while the emissions from its supply chains and the use of its products are known as scope 3.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar Green Century proposal earned a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/costco-shareholder-vote-signals-focus-on-supply-chain-emissions-11643194803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landmark <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/majority-of-costco-shareholders-support-landmark-green-century-proposal-on-climate-change\/\">70% shareholder vote<\/a><\/a> at competitor Costco\u2019s* annual meeting in January. Rather than facing a shareholder vote, Kroger agreed to Green Century\u2019s request, prompting the withdrawal of the shareholder proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see Kroger step up to the plate and commit to disclosing its full climate impact and set high-ambition targets to reduce its emissions. If we are to decarbonize the food system, other retailers will need to do the same,\u201d said Green Century shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kroger has committed to setting targets through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). That will require Kroger, in 2023, to improve its existing scope 1 and 2 emissions targets enough that it plays its part in keeping the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5\u00b0C from pre-industrial levels. Kroger will also set a scope 3 target for the first time and disclose its comprehensive scope 3 emissions, which likely represent the vast majority of its climate impact. For context, Walmart* has estimated that for retailers, <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.walmart.com\/esgreport\/esg-issues\/climate-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">roughly 95% of emissions are in scope 3<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Kroger now will disclose and set a target to reduce emissions related to agriculture, land-use change, and deforestation in its supply chains. Kroger, like other retailers, had been a laggard in reporting on these emissions, as highlighted by sustainability non-profit Ceres\u2019 Food Emissions 50 benchmark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCeres is encouraged by these new commitments from Kroger, as they position Kroger to be one of the first food-retail companies to commit to science-based climate action across its full value chain,\u201d said Julie Nash, Senior Program Director for Food &amp; Forests at Ceres. \u201cKroger stands out among the target \u200bfood-retail companies in Food Emissions 50, an investor initiative designed to reduce emissions in the food sector, by \u200bbeing the first to commit to including forests, land use, and agriculture in its climate targets \u200band its scope 3 emissions disclosure \u2013 which is one of the major engagement priorities of the initiative.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century was among the first investor signatories to the Food Emissions 50 initiative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
