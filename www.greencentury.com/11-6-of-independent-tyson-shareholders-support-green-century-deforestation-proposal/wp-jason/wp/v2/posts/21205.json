Acknowledging its \u201ccustomers&#8217; desire for more autonomy in managing their equipment,\u201d Deere announced in March that it would provide a better repair process by improving remote mobile access to equipment and the ability to download software updates on certain equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century<em>\u00b0<\/em> had filed a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">shareholder proposal<\/a> with Deere in September, asking it to account for its anti-competitive repair policies. Shortly after, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">company requested<\/a> that the Securities and Exchange Commission dismiss the resolution, rather than allow its shareholders to vote on the matter. Deere argued to the SEC it had already addressed the request of the resolution by publicly stating its right to repair policies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich reacted to the news by saying, &#8220;Deere is improving its repair support in response to the tidal wave of pressure from farmers, independent mechanics, investors, lawmakers, regulators, advocacy groups, and customers, a number of whom are taking it to court. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/v7m8mx\/john-deere-promised-farmers-it-would-make-tractors-easy-to-repair-it-lied\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deere did not follow through<\/a> on its previous commitment, so we need to be vigilant.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\">Pressure mounting on Deere to address right to repair<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deere has been under increasing pressure from advocacy organizations, such as<a href=\"https:\/\/uspirg.org\/feature\/usp\/deere-headlights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/uspirg.org\/feature\/usp\/deere-headlights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. PIRG<\/a>,&nbsp; to provide the tools and software needed to fix its tractors and combines. Pressure has also been mounting in capitals across the country: The \u201cAgricultural Right to Repair Act&#8221; was introduced in the U.S. Senate in February and&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.repair.org\/legislation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">34 state legislatures<\/a> have considered right to repair bills in recent years.&nbsp; In addition, farmers from seven different states have filed lawsuits in federal court claiming that Deere has monopolized the market for repair and maintenance of its equipment. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dtnpf.com\/agriculture\/web\/ag\/equipment\/article\/2022\/03\/02\/john-deere-faces-growing-list-right\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deere has disputed that claim.<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor Deere, it\u2019s a classic case of you reap what you sow. Deere has been pushing the limits of its customers\u2019 patience, and farmers need affordable and timely repairs,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cI hope that Deere\u2019s new repair policies will mend fences with farmers and other customers, but that remains to be seen.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
