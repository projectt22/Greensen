All three insurers asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to block the proposals, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.corporatesecretary.com\/articles\/esg\/32969\/insurers-chubb-travelers-and-hartford-face-climate-proposals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the SEC rejected<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.corporatesecretary.com\/articles\/esg\/32969\/insurers-chubb-travelers-and-hartford-face-climate-proposals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> their requests<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">Green Century asks insurers to align with United Nations\u2019 climate recommendations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance companies are under increasing pressure to account for their so-called \u201cinsured emissions\u201d which are the greenhouse gases emitted by their clients. The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) recently recommended that insurers begin aligning with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#8217;s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The UNEP FI also stated, \u201cthe swiftest way to ensure alignment is \u2026 to transition fossil fuel-based energy to renewable energy as soon as possible and cease the construction of any new fossil fuel capacities.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that insurers are covering heavy emitters including coal, oil, and gas companies whose emissions are contributing to climate change, while simultaneously protecting homeowners and businesses from natural catastrophes that are amplified by climate change,\u201d said Ranger. \u201cWe hope that the growing support for our proposals &#8212; from both shareholders and government agencies &#8212; sends a strong signal to companies that it\u2019s time to change. Chubb, Travelers and The Hartford can be part of the solution &#8212; or continue to be part of the problem.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
