Recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/experts\/jennifer-skene\/home-depot-sourcing-wood-products-its-1999\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)<\/a> criticized the retailer for the inadequacy of its wood sourcing policies. Nevertheless, The Home Depot\u2019s board of directors has recommended that shareholders vote against Green Century\u2019s proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/lowes-commits-to-comprehensive-reporting-of-its-forest-footprint-will-also-explore-elimination-of-sourcing-from-primary-forests\/\">withdrew a similar shareholder proposal filed with Lowe\u2019s*<\/a> after The Home Depot\u2019s largest competitor agreed to comply with the proposal\u2019s request by disclosing the impact of its sourcing on primary forests and developing a strategy to mitigate potential negative outcomes associated with its wood sourcing for the climate, biodiversity and human rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis proposal gives The Home Depot\u2019s shareholders an opportunity to urge the company to use its buying power to encourage truly sustainable forestry practices,\u201d said Green Century shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson. \u201cTo mitigate global warming and limit biodiversity collapse, we must end deforestation as soon as possible and preserve the world\u2019s remaining primary forests. The company\u2019s opposition to this proposal and its limited forest risk disclosures leave investors concerned that management is not taking the material financial risks associated with deforestation seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While global deforestation <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2022\/04\/2021-tropical-forest-loss-figures-put-zero-deforestation-goal-by-2030-out-of-reach\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">continues at an alarming pace<\/a>, investor support for deforestation-related shareholder proposals has increased dramatically in recent years.
