We are pleased that a majority of Home Depot\u2019s shareholders have called on the company to accelerate action to end deforestation and the clear-cutting of old growth trees in its supply chains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDestroying ecosystems for a new set of kitchen cabinets is not the bargain that we believe that Home Depot\u2019s customers want. Customers may now be unknowingly purchasing wood logged from endangered forests. The company has the opportunity to change this and use its market power for good.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe look forward to working with Home Depot to implement our proposal. These issues require urgent action: The world\u2019s forests, the species that rely upon them, and our climate cannot wait.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related resource: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/green-century-deforestation-proposal-to-be-considered-at-the-home-depots-annual-meeting\/\">Green Century Deforestation Proposal to Be Considered at The Home Depot\u2019s Annual Meeting<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" \/><\/a>\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
