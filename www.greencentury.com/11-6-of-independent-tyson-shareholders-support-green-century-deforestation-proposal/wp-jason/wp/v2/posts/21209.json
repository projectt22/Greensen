It is critical that food companies act rapidly to reduce their climate impact because greenhouse gas emissions from the food system represent roughly a third of all planet-warming emissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate Thomas Peterson issued the following statement in response to the shareholder vote:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUS Foods shareholders sent a resounding message: The company must accelerate its efforts to limit the climate impact of both its fleets and its supply chains and set ambitious targets to reduce emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. As one of the largest American food distributors, US Foods\u2019 emissions reduction efforts can catalyze change in the food industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUS Foods traces its origins back to the 19th century, but it has never faced a situation quite like this. Climate change will have unprecedented consequences for agricultural supply chains for decades to come, and companies need to adapt to mitigate these impacts and maintain competitiveness. US Foods must therefore implement strategies to limit the emissions generated by the production of the food it distributes, while also reducing the planet-warming pollution from its fleet of roughly 6,500 trucks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis strikingly high majority vote from US Foods shareholders follows a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/costco-shareholder-vote-signals-focus-on-supply-chain-emissions-11643194803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">landmark 70% vote from Costco* shareholders<\/a> in favor of a similar Green Century proposal in January, and underscores that investors expect food companies to act rapidly to reduce their climate impact.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
