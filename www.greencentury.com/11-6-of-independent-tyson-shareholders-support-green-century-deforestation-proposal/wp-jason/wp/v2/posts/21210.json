Green Century filed virtually the same proposal with each company asking them to abide by climate science and stop underwriting fossil fuel expansion. Through filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the companies disclosed that 8.8% and 19.4% of votes cast, respectively, were in favor of the proposal.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich reacted to the news by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with the vote on the first year of these proposals, which signals that shareholders understand that insuring new fossil fuel development may be bad for business. We believe that underwriting more development of coal, oil and gas &#8212; products whose emissions drive climate change &#8212; while simultaneously collecting premiums from customers who seek protection from climate change, is fundamentally incompatible.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 2020, Chubb was the largest commercial property and casualty insurer in the world; The Hartford ranked 8th. Both are believed to offer significant coverage to the fossil fuel industry, and a recent publication entitled, <a href=\"https:\/\/us.insure-our-future.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2022\/02\/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fueling Climate Change The Insurers Behind Brazil\u2019s Offshore Oil Expansion<\/a>, reports that Chubb underwrites policies for Brazil\u2019s national oil company, which has the fifth-largest expansion plans of any oil and gas company in the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">Green Century\u2019s groundbreaking proposals push insurers to change<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century\u2019s groundbreaking proposals ask Chubb and The Hartford to align their underwriting policies with the International Energy Agency\u2019s report, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iea.org\/reports\/net-zero-by-2050\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em> The Roadmap incorporates the recommendation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change. In addition, the Roadmap also articulates that new fossil fuel development is incompatible with maintaining the 1.5 degree Celsius limit on temperature increase.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBecause insurance companies are at the forefront of managing risk, helping companies whose products are filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases makes no sense,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cWe recognize that our proposal is breaking ground by asking for direct changes to Chubb\u2019s and The Hartford\u2019s underwriting strategies for coal, oil and gas projects, and we\u2019re not deterred by the vote result. We\u2019ll continue to engage Chubb and The Hartford and push for a transition away from underwriting fossil fuel expansion. If necessary, we\u2019ll bring the issue in front of shareholders again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>\u00a0About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
