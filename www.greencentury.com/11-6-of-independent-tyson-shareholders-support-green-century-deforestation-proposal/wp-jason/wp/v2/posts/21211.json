Booking Holdings announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bookingholdings.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/BKNG-Climate-Action-Plan-Report-2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new plan<\/a> in March to adopt greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an organization working with more than 3,000 corporations to align with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the proposal was first submitted, Booking Holdings, which is the parent company of the travel sites Booking.com, Priceline, Kayak, and Rentalcars.com, had no publicly stated goals regarding reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the efficiency of its operations or using renewable energy. Along with its newly announced emissions reduction ambitions, Booking Holdings also announced that it had upped its sourcing of renewable energy, which had only covered 29% of its office electricity consumption in 2020, to 100% of its entire operations by the end of 2021, reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 92%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m impressed. Booking Holdings went from having virtually no sustainability ambitions to committing to significant action fairly quickly, especially considering the pandemic,\u201d<a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich<\/a> said. \u201cWe believe the SBTi standard that Booking Holdings is signing up for to be the gold standard for credible corporate emissions reduction goals.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\"><strong>2020 proposal spurred sustainability efforts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Booking Holdings\u2019 emissions commitment is just its latest environmentally conscious action. In November, the company rolled out a new rating system, called the Travel Sustainable badge, to recognize the best sustainability practices of its accommodation partners in five key areas: waste, energy and greenhouse gases, water, supporting local communities and protecting nature. The company notes on its website that third-party experts verify the lodging businesses\u2019 sustainability claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe tourism industry generates approximately 8% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, which is unsustainable,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger, shareholder advocate<\/a> with Green Century. \u201cI believe Booking Holdings recognizes this and sees an opportunity to influence its more than two million accommodation partners by enrolling them in its Travel Sustainable initiative. Booking Holdings\u2019 commitments will help us all tread a little more lightly on the planet.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>###<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
