Green Century filed similar proposals with The Hartford* and Chubb* insurance with similar results. Travelers disclosed vote tallies through the Securities and Exchange Commission website, and the percentage in favor of the proposal was 13.2%.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe vote results are in line with our expectations for this first-of-its kind proposal with the insurance companies, and we\u2019re very pleased with the early support,\u201d stated Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cIf the companies fail to take action, the support was strong enough to allow us to refile proposals next year.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all three insurance companies restrict underwriting policies for most new coal and tar sands projects, there are still loopholes, and none of the three has restrictions on insuring new gas and oil projects. Both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency say that expanding coal, oil, and gas supply will cause the Earth to warm beyond a 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise &#8211; the limit recommended to avert the worst impacts of climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of 2020, Travelers, Chubb, and The Hartford were among the top ten commercial property and casualty insurers in the world &#8211; Chubb was the largest. That year, the three firms took in $47.8 billion in premiums for this type of insurance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natural catastrophes are predicted to continue to challenge insurers&#8217; bottom lines. The Swiss Re Group, a world leader in providing reinsurance and insurance, reported that in 2021, \u201cinsured losses from natural disasters again exceeded the previous ten-year average, continuing the trend of an annual 5 &#8211; 6% rise in losses seen in recent decades.\u201d Further, the United Nations has warned that the global temperature rise is likely to reach the 1.5\u00b0C mark in under five years. Even the insurers themselves acknowledge the challenges that climate change poses, but shareholders may want them to act more quickly and decisively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Green Century will keep pushing insurers to stop supporting fossil fuel polluters<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur proposals direct the insurance companies to fulfill their societal mandate to protect. Preventing insured losses is a rational strategy to maintain profits while enhancing customer well-being and shareholder satisfaction,\u201d said Andrea Ranger, Green Century Shareholder Advocate. \u201cBut the insurers are engaging in this kind of cognitive dissonance by enabling more and more emissions while at the same time telling their customers they\u2019ve got their backs.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
