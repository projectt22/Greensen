The proposal earned 48.9% support, the highest-ever vote in favor of an environmentally focused shareholder proposal at the company, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/engagements.ceres.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ceres database<\/a> that tracks shareholder proposals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Green Century co-filed a similar proposal last year with the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, it garnered support from 35.5% of shareholders. At the time, that was the highest-ever vote in favor of an environmental shareholder proposal at Amazon as per the Ceres database. However, the company did not adequately respond to investor concerns following last year\u2019s vote, prompting this year\u2019s filing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAmazon shareholders have shown for the second year in a row that they believe the company is not doing nearly enough to address its plastic use,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management. \u201cWe urge the company to take shareholders\u2019 concerns to heart and accelerate its plastic reduction efforts.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Amazon does not disclose comprehensive data on its plastic use, research has shown that the company is a large user of plastic packaging. A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/oceana.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/18\/Exposed-Amazons-enormous-and-rapidly-growing-plastic-pollution-problem-2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Oceana <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/oceana.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/18\/Exposed-Amazons-enormous-and-rapidly-growing-plastic-pollution-problem-2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">study<\/a> estimated that the company\u2019s plastic waste increased by 29% from 2019 to 2020 amid the rise of online ordering during the pandemic.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flexible plastics in mailer envelopes and cushioning materials that Amazon uses cannot be collected in curbside recycling bins. Those materials make up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewtrusts.org\/-\/media\/assets\/2020\/07\/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">59<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewtrusts.org\/-\/media\/assets\/2020\/07\/breakingtheplasticwave_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">% of plastic produced<\/a>, but 80% of plastic that ends up in the ocean.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAmazon uses staggering amounts of plastic packaging that is known to pollute the environment,\u201d said Annalisa Tarizzo, a shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the company to develop a plastic reduction strategy in order to mitigate potential reputational risk and protect shareholder value.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon investor Sara Sackner, with support from As You Sow, is the lead filer of the proposal. Green Century is the co-filer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
