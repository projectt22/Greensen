(UPS) tallied votes for a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century\u00b0, Trillium Asset Management and Zevin Asset Management asking it to adopt an independently-verified science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction target in order to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Twenty-eight percent of the votes cast were in favor of the resolution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In response, Green Century President, Leslie Samuelrich and Green Century Advocate Andrea Ranger released the following statements:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhile the vote wasn\u2019t as high as we had hoped, the proposal nevertheless signals that shareholders are concerned about climate in general and setting robust targets for UPS to help mitigate climate change,\u201d said Samuelrich. \u201cIn our view, UPS should adopt science-based emissions reduction targets sooner rather than later, regardless of the outcome of the vote.&nbsp; As shareholders and people who see the ubiquitous brown trucks in our neighborhoods, we have higher expectations of UPS. Climate experts are telling us we need to cut global emissions by 45% by 2030 and to emit net-zero carbon dioxide by 2050. Every country, institution and company, including UPS, has to get on board.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur proposal should make it clear to the UPS board and management that it can take the company\u2019s carbon neutral goal a step further. We believe it should include UPS\u2019 full value chain of emissions and incorporate globally recognized benchmarks such as the Science Based Targets initiative,\u201d said Ranger. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to working with UPS on this extremely important issue.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
