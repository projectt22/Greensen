The proposal was submitted to Builders FirstSource last December. Builders FirstSource\u2019s board has taken the unusual step of withholding a recommendation directing shareholders how to vote on Green Century\u2019s proposal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century\u2019s shareholder proposal asks the company to adopt short-, medium- and long-term science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, including emissions related to deforestation and forest degradation. It also asks Builders FirstSource to adopt renewable energy targets. Both requests will help the company meet the Paris Agreement objective of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial temperatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Builders FirstSource, it is the largest supplier of structural building products, pre-built wood components and construction services to the U.S. residential construction market. Given its size&nbsp; &#8212; with approximately 565 distribution and manufacturing locations and more than $19 billion in net sales in 2021 &#8212; Builders FirstSource likely exerts a significant impact on our climate. But for now, investors have no way of knowing. The company has yet to measure, disclose or set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, including Scopes 1 and 2 from its operations and Scope 3 from its value chain, which includes emissions caused by deforestation and forest degradation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBuilders FirstSource helps its customers make new and renovated homes feel safe and comfortable,\u201d said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cBut the company shouldn\u2019t forget about keeping our collective home secure. Builders FirstSource should accelerate its efforts to cut its emissions, protect the health of the forests that supply its lumber and work diligently to prevent climate change.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Green Century Believes Builders FirstSource Can Accelerate Action to Mitigate its Climate Risks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the company\u2019s proxy statement, Builders FirstSource stated it will quantify and publish its Scope 1 and 2 emissions sometime in 2023.&nbsp; As for its Scope 3 emissions, which come from indirect sources such as transportation and distribution activities and purchased goods and services (e.g. lumber), Builders FirstSource said it will quantify them in the \u201cnear term\u201d but provided no deadline. The company has not published any timelines or targets for the full scope of its emissions reductions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe believe that Builders FirstSource can more effectively manage its climate risks. Its competitor, Lowe\u2019s*, has already committed to set science-based targets with the Science Based Targets initiative by the end of 2022,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cIf Lowe\u2019s can commit to this gold standard of greenhouse gas reduction targets and verification, what\u2019s holding back Builders FirstSource?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>###<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
