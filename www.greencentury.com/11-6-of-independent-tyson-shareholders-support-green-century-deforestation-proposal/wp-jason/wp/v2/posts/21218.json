The proposal additionally asks the company to set goals for sourcing more renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency in its operations, and procuring zero emission vehicles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May, Builders FirstSource\u2019s board took the unusual step of withholding a recommendation on whether shareholders should vote for or against the proposal. It reasoned that the company already had plans to \u201csubstantially comply with the goals of the proposal\u201d but noted that proposal\u2019s disclosures and timelines would be \u201coverly burdensome\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Builders FirstSource describes itself as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bldr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest supplier<\/a> of structural building products, pre-built wood components and construction services to the U.S. residential construction market. To implement a science-based targets, the company would have to reduce its direct, operational emissions, and its indirect emissions, including from timber harvested for the lumber it sells.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich and Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger issued the following statement in response to the shareholder vote:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the majority vote, which signals to us that investors have significant concerns about how Builder FirstSource is managing its climate risk. In our view, how a company manages climate risk is also an indication of how it\u2019s managing other material risks. Even though Builders FirstSource has been growing rapidly in recent years, we expect it to keep pace with evolving investor expectations.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAdopting a science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction target should not be an unreachable goal for Builders FirstSource. Peers, such as Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot, are planning to announce their own science-based targets by 2022 and 2023, respectively. More importantly, however, we believe that the process of target-setting forces companies to understand what their emissions are and where they\u2019re coming from. With this analysis, we think Builders FirstSource will be better prepared to comprehensively address its climate risk.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>###<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
