This commitment comes in exchange for the withdrawal of a Green Century<em>\u00b0<\/em> shareholder proposal calling on the company to stop sourcing ingredients from deforested or degraded land by 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCustomers don\u2019t want to tuck into a Chef Boyardee meal that could be responsible for razing tracts of Amazon rainforest, and investors are increasingly demanding that companies address the material risks posed by deforestation\u201d said Green Century shareholder advocate Thomas Peterson. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re glad to see Conagra step up and agree to stop buying ingredients from suppliers who are responsible for the destruction of tropical forests.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conagra purchases beef, palm oil, soy and cocoa for use in products including Hebrew National hot dogs, Marie Callender\u2019s frozen meals and Swiss Miss hot cocoa mix, among others. These commodities are the leading drivers of deforestation worldwide, particularly in at-risk areas such as the rainforests of Brazil, Indonesia, and C\u00f4te d&#8217;Ivoire.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conagra identifies JBS,* the world\u2019s largest meat processor, as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.conagrabrands.com\/files\/cdp-forests-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">major supplier<\/a> of beef. A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/graphics\/2022-beef-industry-fueling-amazon-rainforest-destruction-deforestation\/?sref=Brs3FVmA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg investigation<\/a> determined that the JBS supply chain is \u201camong the biggest drivers of Amazon deforestation the world has ever known,\u201d and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/sustainable-business\/brazil-audit-finds-32-jbs-cattle-amazon-state-irregular-farms-2021-10-07\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reuters reported<\/a> in 2021 that an audit conducted by Brazilian prosecutors found that JBS purchased more than 300,000 cattle from ranches in the Amazon with \u201cirregularities\u201d including illegal deforestation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cConagra has made significant progress in sourcing more sustainable palm oil since reaching a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\">landmark agreement<\/a> with Green Century in 2014 to end sourcing from palm oil suppliers engaged in deforestation. It\u2019s time for Conagra to extend that standard to its beef and other supply chains, and end sourcing from suppliers that are driving the destruction of the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Peterson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scientists, NGOs, and other stakeholders increasingly agree that corporate science-based emissions targets are not attainable without ending deforestation, and that companies must eliminate deforestation from their supply chains no later than 2025 in order to limit biodiversity loss and reduce emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
