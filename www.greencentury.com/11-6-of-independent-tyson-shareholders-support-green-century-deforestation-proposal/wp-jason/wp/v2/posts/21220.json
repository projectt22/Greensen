Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those associated with a company\u2019s operations and purchased energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>US Foods also committed that 35 percent of its suppliers by emissions, covering 71 percent of purchased goods and services, will have set science-based targets by 2027. This latter goal addresses the company\u2019s scope 3, or value chain emissions, which represent the majority of the company\u2019s climate impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has submitted these targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the leading external validator for corporate climate commitments, for approval. US Foods, the nation\u2019s second-largest food distributor, supplies roughly 250,000 restaurants and other foodservices operators nationwide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate Thomas Peterson issued the following statement in response to this announcement:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe at Green Century congratulate US Foods on announcing its first science-based emissions reduction targets, and for pursuing validation of those targets with the Science Based Targets initiative. The company has accelerated its work on this issue in the months since we began our engagement, and we are pleased that they are listening to the call from their shareholders to address climate risk. The company\u2019s announcement of these targets is a crucial initial step towards the rapid decarbonization needed to curb climate change and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat said, we are disappointed that US Foods has opted to set targets at a lower level of ambition than many of its peers. Leading companies across industries are setting targets aligned with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and starting this month, SBTi will only validate these higher-ambition targets. US Foods has set targets with a well-below two-degree alignment, which is weaker than what was called for by a large majority of the company\u2019s shareholders. We encourage US Foods to continue to accelerate its efforts to mitigate climate risk and reduce emissions in line with investor expectations.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
