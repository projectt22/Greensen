The proposal&nbsp; requests greater disclosure on how the leading electric car company\u2019s lobbying and political activities will help limit global warming, in line with the goals of the <a href=\"https:\/\/unfccc.int\/files\/essential_background\/convention\/application\/pdf\/english_paris_agreement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paris Agreement<\/a>. Despite the clear role that Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles, solar panels, and battery storage \u201cpowerwalls\u201d are playing in the world\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy, the company\u2019s climate lobbying policies are mostly opaque.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 ESG Index recently dropped Tesla from its list of companies. An S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices representative cited contributing factors such as the \u201clack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes\u201d. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s peers, General Motors* and Ford*, scored far better on a recent ranking of corporate political disclosure and accountability than Tesla, which ranked in the bottom tier.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Investors see climate lobbying proposal as call for greater transparency at Tesla&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe would like Tesla to trailblaze the path to transition to a low-carbon future,\u201d said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cBut its mercurial <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/elon-musk-comes-out-against-federal-electric-vehicle-spending-11638892791?mod=e2fb&amp;tesla=y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">founder and CEO<\/a> spoke out against federal support for electric vehicle charging stations, leading us to wonder &#8212; is Tesla lobbying against the tools we need to cut down on climate-changing pollution and meet critical global greenhouse gas reduction targets?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laura Campos, the Director of Corporate and Political Accountability at the Nathan Cummings Foundation said, \u201cTesla has lulled investors into thinking it doesn\u2019t face climate risk. But the truth is, its business model depends on strong climate policy. Investors need more information to understand how Tesla\u2019s lobbying aligns with its business model.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla\u2019s annual general meeting will be held in Austin, Texas, on Aug. 4, at 4:30 pm Central Time. Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger said that Tesla has an opportunity to assuage its shareholders\u2019 concerns.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTesla\u2019s innovative and groundbreaking products are awe-inspiring, and we feel it\u2019s a very good company overall. But we filed our shareholder proposal because we want Tesla to be more than very good. We want it to be great. One way Tesla can do that is by taking stock of its current lobbying policies and incorporating the many available best practices to ensure its governance, disclosures, and lobbying practices bolster our collective efforts to fight climate change.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>###<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
