Removing the presumed \u201cno\u201d votes of the roughly 17% of inside shares, including those held by CEO Elon Musk, independent shareholders may have delivered a majority of 51% of votes cast in support. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal calls on Tesla to publish an evaluation of how its \u201clobbying and policy influence activities (direct and through trade associations and social welfare and nonprofit organizations) align with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal to limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius [by 2100], and how Tesla plans to mitigate risks presented by any misalignment.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Tesla\u2019s considerable contributions to expanding the clean energy and electric vehicle markets, the company has provided limited disclosure on how its board oversees public policy decisions that could affect the growth of the clean energy market and broader climate initiatives. For example, late in 2021, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/elon-musk-comes-out-against-federal-electric-vehicle-spending-11638892791?mod=e2fb&amp;tesla=y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CEO Elon Musk<\/a> signaled opposition to federal incentives for installing electric vehicle charging stations. Investors were left to wonder whether Mr. Musk\u2019s comments reflected Tesla\u2019s viewpoint or whether he had veered from Tesla\u2019s stance on the benefits of charging station incentives. Better board management of disclosure practices may have helped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich issued this statement about the vote result:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with this vote count indicating that our call for better governance practices and lobbying disclosures made sense to our fellow investors. In my mind, the vote doesn\u2019t in any way diminish Tesla\u2019s unparalleled innovations in the electric vehicle and renewable energy spaces nor its critical role in limiting transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. Rather, it\u2019s a reminder that investors care about business risk as it manifests across a company\u2019s operations, which includes how a company influences public policy.&nbsp; We hope Tesla will take the vote result in that spirit.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger added:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTesla clearly has a role in the much-needed transformation to a clean energy-powered future, but when you look under the hood, you want to see what makes the company run. Is the company\u2019s direct and indirect lobbying through trade associations and business alliances working to limit the conditions leading to climate change? Is the board implementing its oversight role of Tesla\u2019s lobbying activities? These are the types of questions we\u2019d like Tesla to answer, and we believe the investor concern we\u2019ve now seen should motivate the board to respond.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>#<\/em>##<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
