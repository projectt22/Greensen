SunRun\u2019s rechargeable solar battery systems deliver reliable clean energy to American households, which helps build a more resilient energy system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunrun\u2019s rechargeable solar battery, Brightbox, was first available regionally and in 2020, was launched in all of the company\u2019s markets, including eight additional states and Washington, D.C.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company\u2019s mission is to \u201ccreate a planet run by the sun and build an affordable energy system that combats climate change and provides energy access for all.\u201d&nbsp; Since solar and batteries can operate economically at small scale and can be located where energy is consumed, it is the reliable energy source that our homes, communities, and country need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century believes that solar energy will play an increasingly important role as we work to speed the transition to a clean energy economy.
