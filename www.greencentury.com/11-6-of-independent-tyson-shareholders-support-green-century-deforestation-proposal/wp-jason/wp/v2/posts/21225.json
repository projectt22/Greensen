Darling&#8217;s whole business model is built around reuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Darling collects residuals from food production (think used cooking oil and other food waste) and converts them into essential ingredients for other products including animal feed, needed pharmaceuticals, and biofuels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I met with Darling Chairman and CEO Randall Stuewe in January to talk about the company&#8217;s climate impact, he explained that through a joint venture called Diamond Green Diesel, Darling is one of the world&#8217;s largest producers of biofuels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always been the original recycler,&#8221; said Steuwe. &#8220;We were the guys that were taking products that were either going to be left out on the field &#8212; put in a landfill, or composted &#8212; and converted them back into sustainable ingredients.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s not a silver bullet when it comes to fuel emissions reduction, the biodiesel that Darling produces from waste fats and used cooking oils produces an 85% reduction in planet-warming emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel use. That&#8217;s truly a significant emissions reduction for a sector like trucking, where alternatives to fossil fuels still face major challenges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s likely why Darling Ingredients was named one of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/press-releases\/2021-04-15\/darling-ingredients-announced-as-one-of-the-50-sustainability-and-climate-leaders?sref=Brs3FVmA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">50 Sustainability and Climate Leaders<\/a>&nbsp;by Bloomberg and TBD Media Group in their 2020 assessment of companies rising to meet the challenges our planet is facing today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century believes that all companies need to adopt the principles of circularity to respond to our accelerating environmental crises. That&#8217;s why we are proud to invest in Darling Ingredients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Green Century Capital Management<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
