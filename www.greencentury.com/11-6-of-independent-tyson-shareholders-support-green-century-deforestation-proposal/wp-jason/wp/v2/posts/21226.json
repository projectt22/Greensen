However, the proposal failed to capture a majority of the votes cast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal asked Tesla to conduct an evaluation describing whether its lobbying and policy influence activities (direct and through trade associations and social welfare and nonprofit organizations) align with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal to limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla has dominated U.S. electric vehicle sales and become one of the largest solar technology providers in the country. However, despite its value to environmentally-responsible investors, it has attracted criticism due its mixed performance on corporate governance issues. In December, Tesla\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/elon-musk-comes-out-against-federal-electric-vehicle-spending-11638892791?mod=e2fb&amp;tesla=y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">founder and CEO<\/a> Elon Musk spoke out against federal support for electric vehicle charging stations even though charging infrastructure is critical to growing the electric vehicle market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich issued this statement about the vote:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAlthough we didn\u2019t attain a majority, we\u2019re still pleased with the outcome of this vote. We believe it shows that&nbsp; investors are seeking better insight into the nuts and bolts of how Tesla is making policy and lobbying decisions. While it makes sense that a company whose core business is designing, manufacturing and selling electric vehicles, solar panels and battery storage would support the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting global warming, it\u2019s not clear whether Tesla has articulated this goal in its direct or indirect lobbying. We think it\u2019s time Tesla did.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger added:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re proud to be Tesla investors and support a company that plays a leading role in a much-needed transition to a future powered by clean energy. Much to its credit, Tesla has grown rapidly in the last several years. However, we seem to be seeing growing pains. Tesla does not appear to be attending to business fundamentals, such as disclosing the policies that guide how it uses its influence. Given the sometimes unpredictable nature of Tesla&#8217;s high-profile CEO, we find it even more essential that the board and management establish policy guardrails. We\u2019ll continue to keep the pressure on Tesla until we see measurable change on this issue.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
