The overall vote tally was 19% in favor of the proposal, which was crafted to boost AMERCO\u2019s ambition to address climate change. However, excluding the nearly 50% of the shares controlled by employees and the family of company founders, the \u201caye\u201d votes may have been closer to 66%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although AMERCO is a leader in the do-it-yourself moving business, boasting a sizable fleet of 186,000 light- and medium-duty vehicles available at 21,000 locations across all 50 U.S. states and 10 Canadian provinces, it is not a leader in quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions from its truck fleet and storage facilities. AMERCO has reported no plans to set emissions reduction targets, nor has it published any, even as the company\u2019s largest institutional investors seek such targets and \u201cquality plans to meet them.\u201d &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\"><strong>Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich and Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger issued the following statements in response to the announcement of the majority vote:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe investor support we received is nothing short of remarkable given that nearly 50% of the stock represents inside ownership,\u201d said Samuelrich. \u201cMitigating greenhouse gas emissions has to be a priority to stabilize both the climate and the global economy. Emissions reductions are predicted to mitigate risks for AMERCO, too, by limiting extreme weather events that can interrupt customer travel and damage the U-Haul fleet and storage buildings.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ranger added, \u201cAMERCO arose from humble beginnings in the 1940\u2019s and built the beloved U-Haul brand that we know today. AMERCO has adapted and innovated since those early days. We believe it can continue to apply that innovative spirit by integrating key climate-friendly strategies from rolling out zero emission U-Haul vehicles to installing solar systems to power its facilities, all while wowing its customers and investors.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp;About Green Century Capital Management<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
