The parts of the sugar cane plant which are not destined for food production are blended into traditional foam cushioning to make Better Foam. In 2021, Puma announced that by 2025, nine out of ten Puma products would be made of more sustainable materials.<\/p>\n<p>Puma is also reducing its use of plastics in its operations and has set a goal to eliminate single-use plastic bags from its stores no later than 2023. Puma is doing more than just reducing plastic pollution, however.<\/p>\n<p>It is also working to cut carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement across its value chain, from its own offices, vehicle fleet, and manufacturing sites to its supplier factories. Puma has made a solid start by powering its offices, stores and warehouses with 100% renewable energy. The company has also sourced 99% of its cotton from sustainable sources and aims to reduce its landfill waste by 50% and implement a take back program in all of its major markets by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/international-index-fund\/\">International Index Fund&#8217;s investment strategy.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more about investing with Green Century, please reach out today.
