Hegar included Green Century in that list and all three of the Green Century Funds are included among 350 funds.<\/p>\n<p>The listed companies are subject to the divestment provisions outlined in Texas Government Code Chapter 809, which defines a financial company as a publicly traded financial services, banking or investment company. Additionally, the Comptroller\u2019s staff conducted research on individual investment funds, generating the list of nearly 350 funds that are subject to the same provisions as the companies. <\/p>\n<p>None of the state governmental entities subject to the investment prohibitions and divestment requirements (Employees Retirement System of Texas, Teacher Retirement System of Texas, Texas Municipal Retirement System, Texas County and District Retirement System, Texas Emergency Services Retirement System and the Permanent School Fund) currently invest in the Green Century Funds. <\/p>\n<p>In response to the announcement, Green Century Capital Management President Leslie Samuelrich issued the following statement: <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are proud that the Green Century Funds constitute the first family of fossil fuel free funds, which are both environmentally friendly and diversified. We strive to make all of our decisions in the best interest of our shareholders, many of whom are aware of our motto and chose us intentionally because we exclude coal, oil and gas companies.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201c Comptroller Hegar and the Texas legislature are weaponizing the state\u2019s pension funds to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry. That same industry has driven the climate crisis linked to the heat waves, droughts and erratic weather &#8212; such as the recent devastating floods in Dallas &#8212; that Texans, and everyone else, regardless of their political beliefs, are facing. We believe that the hard-working individuals of Texas should have the freedom to invest in ways that reflect their environmental values and protect their quality of life without intrusion from the state.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About Green Century Capital Management<\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
