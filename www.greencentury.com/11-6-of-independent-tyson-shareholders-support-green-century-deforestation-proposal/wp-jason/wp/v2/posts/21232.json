Investors have sent an unmistakable message that General Mills needs to do something about its plastic packaging footprint.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The United States\u2019 plastic recycling rate clocked in at a dismal 5%-6% in 2021, and studies show that corporations need to reduce their absolute use of plastic by one-third by 2040 to bring the plastic pollution problem under control. Some companies are starting to cut plastic voluntarily from their packaging, and those that aren\u2019t may soon have to, legally. Both Colorado and California passed \u201cExtended Producer Responsibility\u201d laws this year that require companies to take responsibility for their waste, and the issue is gaining traction in other state houses across the country.<\/p>\n<p>As a response, in part, to this changing regulatory landscape, General Mills\u2019 competitors including Kellogg\u2019s, Unilever and Procter &#038; Gamble have made public commitments to reduce plastic packaging by 2025. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe bottom line is that companies know they need to cut plastic, and many are starting to act,\u201d said Annie Sanders, Green Century\u2019s director of shareholder advocacy. \u201cThis majority vote from shareholders gives General Mills marching orders to establish a baseline plastic footprint so the company can assess what&#8217;s possible. Investors, consumers  and the planet demand it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>### <\/p>\n<p>About Green Century Capital Management<\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
