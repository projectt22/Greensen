In the ensuing decades, it has become a leader in environmental investing. Green Century takes a three-pronged approach: building a portfolio of environmentally responsible companies, proposing and executing effective shareholder advocacy and giving 100% of the profits earned from managing the funds to environmental nonprofits.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of its shareholder advocacy, Green Century has won concessions from many major corporations. This summer alone, Green Century proposals spurred Conagra to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains and prompted US Foods to set science-based emissions reduction targets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile traditional advocacy methods including grassroots organizing and investigative reports sometimes get companies to do the right thing for the environment, unfortunately, sometimes it takes the threat of shareholder action,\u201d said Samuelrich, who has run Green Century for the past ten years. \u201cEven when dealing with giants such as Amazon, Costco or McDonald\u2019s, we don\u2019t shrink from our fiduciary and societal responsibility to hold companies we invest in accountable to shareholders and the greater good.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>#<br \/>\nAbout Green Century Capital Management<\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
