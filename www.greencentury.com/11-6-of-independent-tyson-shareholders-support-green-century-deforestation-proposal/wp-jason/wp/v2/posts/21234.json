The distinction involves the way each investment is taxed. In the case of traditional IRAs, the investor provides \u201cpre-tax\u201d contributions. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, involve \u201cafter-tax\u201d contributions. But what does that actually mean for your retirement fund? What are the benefits of a traditional IRA vs a Roth IRA?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Green Century we offer a wide array of investment vehicles including both Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs. Learn more about each type of investment and its benefits below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What are Traditional IRAs?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a traditional IRA (short for \u201cindividual retirement account\u201d), investors receive immediate tax benefit for money they contribute to the account (up to certain limits). This is what we mean when we say traditional IRAs allow for \u201cpre-tax\u201d contributions. The money that flows into traditional IRAs is not subject to taxation at the time it is invested or earned. Instead, you pay tax on the amounts you withdraw from the account at a later date, usually in\/for retirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits of traditional IRAs accrue from the deferral of taxes. In other words, money that would otherwise go to the government in the form of tax payments up front is instead invested and earns a return. While you do have to pay tax at a later date, your money grows in the meantime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IRA&#8217;s may work well for people who currently find themselves subject to high marginal tax rates: high earners with money left over to save and invest. The immediate tax break can offset what would otherwise be significant taxation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should be aware that there are required minimum distributions you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> take that begin at age 72. Also, traditional IRAs are subject to maximum contribution amounts that differ depending on your age. If you\u2019re under the age of 50, the maximum annual contribution is currently $7,000, while those over 50 may contribute up to $8,000 per year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What are Roth IRA Accounts?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a Roth IRA, investors contribute \u201cafter-tax\u201d money to the investment vehicle. In other words, you don\u2019t get an immediate tax deduction or credit for the money you contribute to a Roth IRA. Instead, the benefit of a Roth IRA is that any investment gains in your Roth IRA can be withdrawn at a later date, tax-free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roth IRAs are especially useful if you expect your marginal tax rate to be significantly higher at the time you withdraw your investment compared to the time you make your initial contributions. For example, this would be true of people who expect to earn more later in their careers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for your withdrawals to be tax-free, the account must have been open for a minimum of 5 years at the time of your first withdrawal. Additionally, you must be at least 59.5 years old when you make your first withdrawal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also know that there are income limits for those seeking to make use of a Roth IRA. Individuals earning more than $144,000 in the year 2022 &#8211; or married couples earning more than $214,000 annually &#8211; may not contribute to a Roth IRA.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Open a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA with Green Century<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no single right answer for people trying to decide between a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/ira-information\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">traditional IRA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> vs. a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/ira-information\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roth IRA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
