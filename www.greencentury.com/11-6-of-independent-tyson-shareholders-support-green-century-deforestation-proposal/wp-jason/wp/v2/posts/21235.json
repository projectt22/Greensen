Timken has now adopted targets to reduce the intensity of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions (emissions from its direct operations) by 50% by 2030 in its manufacturing facilities with more than 100 employees. <\/p>\n<p>An Ohio-based manufacturer of engineered steel bearings, Timken supplies critical components for the automotive, rail, renewable energy and agricultural industry sectors. In recent years, Timken has experienced double-digit revenue growth in the renewable energy market sector, where its bearings help wind turbine blades turn smoothly and help trackers that hold solar panels reliably follow the sun.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are pleased with Timken\u2019s new commitment to halve its emissions intensity in 8 years\u2019 time,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s a big first step for a company that had no greenhouse gas reduction targets just a year ago. We\u2019re proud to have been a catalyst in its process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Timken\u2019s announcement comes as its automotive customers, including BMW, Ford, Mercedes and Tesla, have all set or committed to set science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement\u2019s goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. These commitments, made through the Science Based Targets initiative, mean that auto manufacturers are now accountable for reducing emissions from their full value chain. To meet their objectives, they will likely press suppliers such as Timken to cut their emissions in the not-too-distant future.<br \/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting because Timken is part of this economy-wide transition to clean energy, and its products can be found in GE\u2019s 14 MW Haliade-X, the world&#8217;s most powerful wind turbine, and in more than a third of the world\u2019s utility-scale solar projects,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. But, Timken can\u2019t just sell its products to renewable energy companies and pat itself on the back. It has to account for its own contributions to climate change, which is why we welcome its newly announced goal to cut its operational emissions.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
