The commitment comes after 70% of its voting shareholders opted in January 2022 for a Green Century proposal asking Costco to include the emissions from its producers, shippers and other partners when setting targets to reach net zero emissions by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith this commitment, Costco is no longer a laggard among its peers. So, we congratulate the company on committing to reduce its contribution to climate change,\u201d said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cCostco\u2019s plan to set a scope 3 emissions reduction target in 2023 shows that the company is starting to treat climate change with the gravity that the issue \u2013 and shareholders \u2013 demand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Historically, Costco has significantly trailed many of its competitors on climate action, standing out as one of only three of the largest 50 S&#038;P companies without a major climate commitment as of December 2021. At Costco\u2019s January 2022 annual meeting, Green Century called on the company to set science-based emissions reduction targets for its scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions that would lead to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those from a company\u2019s operations and purchased energy, while the emissions from its supply chains and the use of its products are known as scope 3.<\/p>\n<p>In response, Costco committed to disclosing the company\u2019s aggregate scope 3 emissions and action plan in 2022, and to set scope 3 reduction targets in 2023, which likely represents the vast majority of the company\u2019s climate impact. (For context, Walmart* has estimated that for retailers, roughly 95% of emissions are in scope 3.) In addition, Costo committed to updating its scope 1 and 2 emissions targets and action plans as part of its revised Climate Action Plan coming out in December 2022.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCostco has certainly accelerated its work on this issue and we are pleased that it is heeding the call from shareholders to address climate risk,\u201d said Green Century\u2019s Director of Shareholder Advocacy Annie Sanders. \u201cThat said, we are disappointed that the company has declined to pursue alignment of the company\u2019s climate targets with the Science Based Targets initiative, the global body enabling businesses to set emissions reduction targets in line with science. We strongly urge Costco to join its peers in taking this crucial step to avoid the worst consequences of climate change and mitigate climate risk in line with investor expectations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>About Green Century Capital Management<br \/>\n\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
