Various experts say businesses and governments around the world need to take such action on an expedited timeline to avoid the worst consequences of climate change and protect special places such as the Amazon rainforest.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany everyday people don\u2019t want their meat to come with a side of rainforest destruction,\u201d said Green Century Funds President <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/leslie-samuelrich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>. \u201cHormel Foods has taken an important step to protect forest ecosystems and biodiversity around the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first half of 2022 broke records for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, and cattle production drives 90 percent of deforestation in that region. To produce its extensive line of meat products from Old Smokehouse and Valley Fresh to the iconic SPAM canned pork, Hormel buys ingredients from high-risk regions throughout South America and Indonesia.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeef and soy comprise two of the four the leading drivers of deforestation globally, particularly in South America,\u201d said Green Century\u2019s Director of Shareholder Advocacy <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/annie-sanders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Annie Sanders<\/a>. \u201cHormel\u2019s commitment to eliminate deforestation in its supply chain by 2025 shows that the company knows it\u2019s time to end sourcing from suppliers that are driving the destruction of key ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Beef and soy are leading drivers of deforestation<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Hormel\u2019s commitment follows promises of its peers, including Tyson Foods and Conagra, to eliminate deforestation across supply chains. These no-deforestation pledges have proliferated in recent years as international standard-setting bodies such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/sciencebasedtargets.org\/sectors\/forest-land-and-agriculture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Science Based Targets initiative<\/a> have concluded that corporate climate emissions targets are not achievable without ending deforestation, and that companies must eliminate deforestation from their supply chains no later than 2025 to protect biodiversity and reduce emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDeforestation is a type of native vegetation conversion, which means the change of a natural ecosystem to another land use, such as farming,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cLand use change is responsible for nearly 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so no-deforestation commitments are just a first step. We believe Hormel and other companies must also eliminate native vegetation conversion to sustain the ecosystems on which they \u2013 and all of us \u2013 depend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14458\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><i>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
