Scope 3 emissions, which include things such as transportation that occur outside of a company\u2019s direct control, can represent an enormous portion of a retailer\u2019s carbon footprint. Last year, Walmart and Target reported on every category of their scope 3 emissions, which comprised 95% and 97% of their total greenhouse gas output, respectively. By contrast, Amazon reported on only a portion of its scope 3 emissions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in 2021, Amazon only disclosed product-related emissions for its Amazon-branded products such as Kindles, Fire TVs or Whole Foods\u2019 365 products. However, private-label products represent a mere 1% of its sales. The rest of the products it sells directly or through third party vendors, comprise 39% and 60% of total sales, respectively. Unlike Amazon, Walmart and Target do not parse out emissions from their private-label brands versus products from other manufacturers or products sold on their third-party platforms. It\u2019s likely, therefore, that Amazon is significantly undercounting its total emissions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat Amazon is doing &#8212; or, should I say, not doing &#8212; is not acceptable,\u201d said Green Century Funds President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>. \u201cIt needs to play by the same set of rules as everyone else and disclose all indirect emissions up and down its value chain. As climate-concerned investors, we believe Amazon has a responsibility to use its vast resources and influence to reduce its burgeoning carbon footprint.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Emissions grow but Amazon\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions disclosures are still lacking<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In 2019, Amazon launched an ambitious initiative called the Climate Pledge, inviting other companies to commit to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 &#8212; 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement\u2019s target year of 2050. Since that time, Amazon\u2019s sales have nearly doubled, in large part due to pandemic-fueled at-home purchasing; consequently, Amazon\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions &#8212; at least the ones it discloses &#8212; have risen by nearly 40% in the same time period.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWalmart and Target are doing the math for all the brands they sell &#8211; from bottles of Tide to Samsung TVs. They\u2019re adding up all the emissions that go into making the bottle, the laundry detergent, the energy used by the washing machine, and they\u2019re counting the emissions that go into the parts and pieces of the TV, and the electricity used to run the TV once it\u2019s home,\u201d Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger<\/a> said. \u201cThis accounting is important because you can\u2019t manage what you can\u2019t measure. We fully expect that Walmart and Target will use their influence to lean on manufacturers to cut their emissions in smart and timely ways. Amazon needs to get on board and do likewise \u2013 now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><strong>About The Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
