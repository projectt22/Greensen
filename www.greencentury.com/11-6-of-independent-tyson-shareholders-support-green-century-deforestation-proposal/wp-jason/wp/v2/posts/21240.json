It is widely held that burning fossil fuels is the primary driver of climate change, so by extending insurance coverage to new coal, oil and gas operations, the companies support the growth of this polluting and environmentally onerous industry.<\/p>\n<p>The insurance and banking sectors have undergone increased scrutiny in recent years for their outsized roles in underwriting new risks and providing capital for exploration, drilling, pipelines, ports and power station construction. Many scientists agree that approving new oil and gas fields paves the way for accelerated climate change and more extreme weather events.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Green Century filed similar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/votes-on-green-century-proposal-at-travelers-concludes-series-of-filings-at-major-insurers\/\">proposals<\/a> and won challenges by the companies at the SEC to bring the resolutions to the proxy ballot. After the insurers failed to change their policies regarding their underwriting and general liabilities in discussions with investors, Green Century filed proposals for consideration by shareholders at the companies\u2019 2023 annual meetings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the companies charged with protecting us from disasters are exacerbating the devastating effects on our homes and lives from climate change-related floods, hurricanes and wildfires,\u201d Green Century Funds President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a> said. \u201cBy refusing to adopt this common-sense change to reduce risks for its customers, Chubb, The Hartford, and Travelers are supporting the industry most responsible for climate change and falling behind their European industry peers who have already assessed and addressed these risks.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Chubb, The Hartford and Travelers\u2019 insurance policies help prop up fossil fuel industry<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While some insurers and fossil fuel companies are using the war in Ukraine to call for development of new oil and gas supplies, some energy experts assert that existing and approved planned development of fossil fuels are sufficient to satisfy global energy needs. The long lead time for new oil and gas fields would not produce fuel in time to mitigate the turmoil in current energy markets, and for decades to come, would produce carbon pollution that scientists agree the planet cannot afford.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFossil fuel projects don\u2019t get built without insurance. Period,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger<\/a>. \u201cThis means that for years, Chubb, The Hartford and Travelers\u2019 insurance policies have enabled capital to flow to projects that lock us into decades and decades of carbon pollution we can\u2019t afford to emit. And, regrettably, insured losses from climate-related weather catastrophes are continuing to grow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While all three insurance companies have grown their renewable energy underwriting portfolios in recent years, climate experts from the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change state that fossil fuel development must be phased out even if renewable energy investments rise. Additionally, none of the three insurers has excluded underwriting fossil fuel projects in sensitive areas like the Arctic, a region that has warmed nearly four times faster than the rest of the world since 1979.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About The Green Century Funds<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
