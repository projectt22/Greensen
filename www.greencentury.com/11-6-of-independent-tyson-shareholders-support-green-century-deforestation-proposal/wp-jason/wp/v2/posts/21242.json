The update sets targets for the \u201cresponsible use\u201d of medically important antibiotics. While demonstrating some progress, the new policy does not include a timeline for implementation or a way to verify progress toward its goals. This plan is not as clear as a similar commitment that McDonald\u2019s made in 2018, then failed to uphold. Green Century Capital Management has filed a shareholder proposal asking the fast food giant to reinstate its initial commitment and include a timeline for meeting it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFirst, McDonald\u2019s failed to meet its own deadline for addressing antibiotic overuse in its beef supply chain. Now, it has released a policy to promote responsible antibiotic use that lacks any teeth,\u201d said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, president of Green Century Funds. \u201cGiven McDonald\u2019s history of not following through, including its failure to eliminate the use of pig gestation crates in its supply chain, we worry that without a clear timeline for implementation, this antibiotics commitment is just wishful thinking.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Administering regular doses of antibiotics to animals being raised for food can spur development of \u2018superbugs,\u2019 bacteria that are so resistant to treatment that even our most potent antibiotics can fail to stop the disease. Superbugs can afflict people who handle infected meat from the supermarket or drink water polluted by farm runoff. Farm workers and meat processors may also encounter direct exposure to these potentially deadly bacteria. In 2021, the United Nations announced that we may soon reach a\u00a0 \u2018tipping point\u2019 when antimicrobial resistance surpasses heart disease as the leading cause of death.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGiven the potential for a worldwide crisis of antibiotic resistance, McDonald\u2019s needs to accelerate action by its meat suppliers by imposing concrete internal and external timelines,\u201d said <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Ranger<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Green Century shareholder advocate. \u201cGreen Century\u00b0 and the nuns of Congregation of Benedictine Sisters filed a shareholder proposal in early December to hopefully spur such action. This nebulous response from McDonald\u2019s will not satisfy its many investors who are worried about the health of their friends and families &#8212; and expect more from a company of McDonald\u2019s stature and clout.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b><i>About The Green Century Funds<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
