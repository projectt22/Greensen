He points to major ESG asset managers, such as BlackRock, which make lofty statements about their climate credentials but are heavily invested in fossil fuel companies.<\/p>\n<p>As an example, BlackRock\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/url.emailprotection.link\/?b2xyL9bW45wFVCE38OIfAEEAIImUtCihHP-LWeDoZ0PKa97tSbUy6ZXARN8i07sB1dkUK17VsWQE9tTfgJLGFfSG05UI-cws5Fi0AnBvCkLwsL1pf06PQ9mULzh4_8Z795aF1xV2IwpimfUKayQy4MxsZysYNca38f5zCn0RDuXk~\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Carbon Readiness Transition Fund\u00a0<\/a>touts the fund\u2019s \u201cbroad exposure to large- and mid-capitalisation U.S. companies tilted towards those that BlackRock believes are better positioned to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy\u201d. In fact, the $1.4 billion fund has significant holdings in three of the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel companies: ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller boutique investment firms such as Trillium Asset Management and Green Century Funds use a starkly different approach on ESG investing, emphasising both planetary impact and healthy stock returns.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Green Century, ESG investing means screening out all fossil fuel companies, investing in climate solutions, such as the makers of electronic vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy, and holding lots of green bonds.<\/p>\n<p>ESG rating firms will give you \u2018best of class\u2019 fossil fuel companies, but we don\u2019t want them<\/p>\n<p>\u201cScreening is how we get rid of industries that are not sustainable, such as fossil fuel companies,\u201d said Green Century chief executive Leslie Samuelrich, whose firm manages nearly $1 billion in assets. \u201cESG rating firms will give you \u2018best of class\u2019 fossil fuel companies, but we don\u2019t want them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Trillium has not dropped fossil fuel companies altogether, but it only invests in those that stop investing capital on new fossil fuel reserves. No companies are meeting that criteria today, according to Trillium\u2019s head of ESG strategy, Elizabeth Levy.<\/p>\n<p>King says the Green Century and Trillium examples are all too rare in the booming ESG landscape.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe good stuff are the boutique firms, which are impact investing and direct investing in breakthrough technologies or dedicated funds like offshore wind,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, the stuff that\u2019s really grown is the junk in the middle. It\u2019s stuff that feels right to investors, but it\u2019s not exactly what it seems.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>U.S. and European financial regulators have both been ratcheting up their focus on ESG investing.<\/p>\n<p>The scrutiny comes as sustainability threats like climate change are worsening and ESG investing is soaring, eclipsing $35 trillion in global assets in 2020 and fast approaching $40 trillion this year.
