For <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/the-green-century-funds\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Green Century Funds<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, environmentally responsible and sustainable investing means keeping money out of environmentally onerous industries and companies that impose onerous costs on the environment and society, such as fossil fuel companies that are driving climate change, tobacco companies that are causing suffering and deaths, and nuclear energy or nuclear weapons companies that create radioactive waste.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, in the fixed income portion of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/balanced-fund\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Century Balanced Fund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, more than 60% of the holding are green bonds, which means that the bonds help finance environmental projects that produce renewable energy, protect water supplies or reduce greenhouse gasses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>Are Sustainable Investments Profitable?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those new to the field may wonder if sustainable investing is profitable and even financial advisors unfamiliar with sustainable investing may assume that a sustainable investment strategy may affect performance and returns.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing fossil fuel free, also called divestment, may help to avoid potential financial and performance risks associated with the fossil fuel industry. Leading asset manager, GMO, stated in The Mythical Peril of Divesting from Fossil Fuels that \u201cinvestors with long-term horizons should avoid all oil and chemical stocks on investment grounds.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other specific financial and performance reasons to consider divestment include volatility \u2013 the energy sector was the most volatile sector in the 2010s and stranded assets.\u00a0 Fossil fuel reserves impact the valuations of coal, oil and gas companies. If companies are unable to extract and sell their reserves \u2013 for reasons such as changing demand, government regulation or lawsuits \u2013 they may be forced to prematurely \u201cwrite off\u201d those assets. Stranded assets can negatively affect a company\u2019s valuation or share price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Green Century Funds also use Environmental, Social, and Governance data and ratings, known more commonly as ESG, which may help reduce risk and enhance profitability.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, a sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>How to Ensure Sustainable Investments<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Century ensures that Green Century Funds are investing sustainably in three ways.
