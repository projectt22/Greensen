In this process, breeding pigs are housed in groups rather than restrictive \u201cgestation\u201d crates for at least a majority of each pregnancy cycle. Green Century pressed Jack in the Box to make this transition after a decade of failed promises to do so. Gestation crates confine pregnant sows in spaces that are roughly 2 feet by 7 feet, areas so small that they can\u2019t even turn around. Nine states ban the practice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJack in the Box made a promise in 2012 to eliminate gestation crate usage from its supply chain by 2022 but it didn\u2019t keep its pledge,\u201d said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cShareholders want companies to uphold their commitments &#8212; and everyone wants to see animals treated as humanely as possible. Companies who fail to do either or both incur reputational risks. We\u2019re pleased to see Jack in the Box finally taking action on this important animal welfare issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jack in the Box\u2019s competitors have made progress on sourcing pork from suppliers that have reduced or eliminated gestation crates.\u00a0 McDonald\u2019s will reach 100% \u201cgroup housed\u201d pork by 2024 in the United States, as will Burger King and Tim Hortons (in both the U.S. and Canada). Wendy\u2019s, Panera Bread and other quick service chains have already achieved that goal in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhether you\u2019re a fan of Jack in the Box\u2019s bacon double cheeseburger or just an investor worried that your company is not tuned into animal welfare issues and the oft-correlated competitive and reputational damage, Jack in the Box\u2019s new announcement is welcomed news,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cWe appreciate that Jack in the Box quickly established a hard cutoff date to switch to 100% group housed pork. There\u2019s no excuse for putting pregnant pigs in the equivalent of animal jail.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
