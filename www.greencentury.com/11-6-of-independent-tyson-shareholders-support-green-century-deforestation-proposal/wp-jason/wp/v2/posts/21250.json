I want to share what my first few months on the job have been like beyond the words \u201cwhirlwind\u201d and \u201cinspiring\u201d \u2013 though that could certainly sum it up!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the beginning of July, Green Century\u2019s advocacy team has engaged 45 companies, filed 32 shareholder resolutions, and has already won 10 majority votes, commitments or policies to set greenhouse gas reduction targets, protect tropical forests, reduce plastic pollution, improve animal welfare, and more. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the hard work we\u2019ve put in and the tangible results we\u2019ve won \u2013 all of which is only possible thanks to the support of our investors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14881\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/dinty-moore-300x221.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"221\" \/>You may be wondering \u2013 what exactly does a company engagement look like? Let\u2019s take our engagement with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hormelfoods.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormel Foods<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">* as an example. You\u2019ve probably heard of SPAM, Hormel Chili, or \u2013 a classic for boomers \u2013 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/dinty-moore-beef-stew-original-1957-vintage-color-print--340373684348883043\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dinty Moore Beef Stew<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Hormel is one of the 10 biggest meat processing companies in the world, and to produce its extensive line of meat products, Hormel sources beef from, among other places, South America. Maddeningly, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/climate-environment\/2022\/07\/08\/amazon-rainforest-deforestation-record-climate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the first half of 2022 broke records for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where the practice of clearing land for cattle production drives 90% of deforestation. After we filed our proposal asking Hormel to address deforestation in its supply chain, the company engaged in several discussions with Green Century to learn more about these biodiversity risks. In November 2022, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/release-hormel-foods-commits-to-no-deforestation-by-2025\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormel committed to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains by 2025<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and only source beef that wasn\u2019t raised on destroyed rainforests, helping to protect endangered species like the jaguar and macaw for years to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-14880\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Sysco-300x167.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On our Preventing Plastic Pollution work, we filed a proposal at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sysco.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sysco<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*, the largest food distributor in the world, on reducing the company\u2019s plastic packaging. Though not necessarily a household name, you\u2019ve probably seen Sysco\u2019s\u00a0trucks\u00a0around town delivering food to hospitals, grocery stores, schools, and other institutions. The company lacks a sustainable packaging policy, which is rapidly becoming an industry standard due to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2023\/01\/06\/climate\/plastics-climate-pollution.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plastic\u2019s potency as a major polluter of oceans and other wildlife habitat worldwide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. After <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/sysco-shareholders-call-for-less-plastic-packaging\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Century\u2019s proposal won an overwhelming 92% majority vote<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November, Sysco committed to issuing a comprehensive report in 2023 detailing how it can reduce its overall plastic use, which will help protect ocean wildlife and reduce microplastics in our food and water.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14879\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Picture4-300x177.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"177\" \/>And then sometimes, wins come unexpectedly. After engagement with Green Century last spring, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lowes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*, the second largest home improvement retailer in the US, committed to producing a report by December 2022 detailing how it could accelerate its efforts to stop selling wood linked to deforestation and the degradation of primary forests in its supply chain. Along with the promised assessment, Lowe\u2019s went one step further and included a set of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.lowes.com\/sites\/lowes-corp\/files\/2022-12\/lowes-2022-forestry-report-12-28-22.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">industry-leading sustainable wood sourcing commitments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2013 informed by Green Century\u2019s conversations with the company \u2013 that will help protect forests, including the Canadian boreal, around the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kind of impact is at the heart of Green Century\u2019s work. Through our engagements, Green Century\u2019s advocates make the case for why companies must act to protect the natural world they depend on for their business \u2013 and that all of us depend on for a livable planet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thank you for your investment in that impact, and for making our work possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sincerely, Annie<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>About Green Century Funds<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
