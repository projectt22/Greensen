Greenwashing is making false claims about how <em>your<\/em> investment protects the environment. With more mainstream firms looking to capitalize on people\u2019s desire to align their investments with their environmental values, greenwashing has grown. Most firms don\u2019t blatantly misrepresent their product since there are regulatory rules and fines involved, but their marketing claims can be confusing and imply more value alignment or impact than it actually offers. To avoid greenwashed products, financial advisors and investors need to look under the hood of a product and firm and understand that there is a difference between having an investment reflect your values, such as avoiding a certain industry, and making an impact on that issue in the community or world.\u00a0 Some investments can do both, as the Green Century Funds do, but others may seem like they do, but don\u2019t. Investors should ask their financial advisors or mutual fund companies how they define greenwashing, how they avoid it in products they use and how specifically they align the investment with environmental values. Lastly, don\u2019t let the ubiquitous pretty pictures of nature fool you into investing in a greenwashed product.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>ESG vs Impact<\/b><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is ESG?\u00a0 ESG is an abbreviation for environmental, social, and governance factors. \u00a0 ESG is simply the data or information about a company\u2019s environmental, social and governance performance. Confusion about terms occurs because ESG is often used as a large umbrella term interchangeable with sustainable and responsible investing, though it is really just the underlying data.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some, but not all, investment managers use material or significant ESG <strong>data<\/strong> in their investment decisions.\u00a0 This does not necessarily provide positive environmental or social impact or benefit in the real world, however, since it is difficult to trace specific investments to concrete company behavior, and the change may have occurred even without a particular investment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positive and negative screening, which includes or excludes specific industry sectors or companies from a portfolio, is often a better way to align a portfolio with clients\u2019 values.\u00a0 Screening is also often confused with ESG, and while it provides stronger alignment, it may not necessarily lead to positive impact.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, impact can be achieved through engaging with companies to improve their ESG performance.\u00a0 Such shareholder advocacy as voting proxies, filing shareholder resolutions and advocating for change can lead to companies improving their policies and practices, which can lead to real-world, concrete, measurable change.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Shareholder Advocacy<\/b><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is shareholder advocacy? Shareholder advocacy leverages the power of stock ownership in publicly-traded companies to promote environmental, social, and governance (ESG) change from within. Through this type of advocacy, shareholders can influence a corporation&#8217;s behavior by exercising their rights as partial owners. Shareholder advocacy encompasses a variety of strategies that responsible investors can use to engage with companies in their investment portfolios on ESG issues, including dialogue with corporate executives, filing shareholder resolutions, proxy voting, participation in annual general meetings, and investor letters.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shareholder advocacy was robust from 2017 through 2020. Though it saw some decline in 2020, partly due to economic and business disruptions related to COVID-19, it\u2019s bouncing back: large-cap companies in the United States saw a 30% increase in shareholder advocacy campaigns in early 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, and that trend looks likely to continue.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only are shareholders increasingly stepping up to advocate for environmental proposals, but more activist efforts are succeeding. Historically, businesses could generally count on these efforts failing, but that David and Goliath dynamic is slipping. Nearly 20% of the social and political shareholder proposals voted on in 2021 received majority votes, up from approximately 10% in 2020. The figure was approximately 38% for environmental proposals, compared to about 21% in 2020.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><b>Green Centuries Key Takeaways<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was good to be back out on the road this fall. Our key takeaway from the conferences is that there is more interest in aligning environmental concerns with investment decisions than ever before, and it\u2019s incumbent upon investment advisors to help investors separate marketing tactics from authentic products.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What is the Future of Sustainable Investing<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sustainable investing is here to stay, particularly as more companies work to reduce their impact on climate change. The conferences that we\u2019ve recently sponsored and participated in underscore the fact that growing numbers of investors are interested in using at least a portion of their portfolio towards demanding significant change.\u00a0 And as a 30+ year veteran in the field, we\u2019re ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Invest Sustainably with Green Century Funds<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Green Century Funds have been helping investors align their investments with their values for more than 30 years.\u00a0 As a pioneer in environmentally and sustainable investing, the Funds provide a way for investors to avoid environmentally onerous industries to create a more sustainable world.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/open-an-account\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open an account online<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/download-forms\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">download forms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/request-materials\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">request written materials<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to start investing sustainably.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14264\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>About Green Century Funds<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
