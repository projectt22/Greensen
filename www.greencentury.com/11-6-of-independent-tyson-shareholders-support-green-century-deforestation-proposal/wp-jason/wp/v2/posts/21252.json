The leading online retailer has begun Q1 of 2023 by sending a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/divisions\/corpfin\/cf-noaction\/14a-8\/2023\/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter<\/a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 20 arguing that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/green-century-as-you-sow-file-shareholder-proposal-with-amazon-seeking-disclosure-of-entire-carbon-footprint\/\">shareholder proposal<\/a> put forward by Green Century\u00b0 and Amalgamated Bank should be blocked from the company\u2019s 2023 proxy ballot. The proposal requests that Amazon measure and disclose all of its scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions related to its physical stores and e-commerce operations. In its 16-page letter, Amazon writes to the SEC that the \u201cProposal seeks to micromanage the Company\u201d and improperly restricts its ability to choose which scope 3 emissions to report.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAmazon has an obligation to ensure that investors and potential investors know its material risks so they can make prudent decisions. Disclosure is at the heart of this process,\u201d said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cOur proposal simply asks Amazon to do what Walmart and Target are already doing &#8212; using well-established standards to report indirect emissions associated with running their businesses. We\u2019re disappointed that Amazon is choosing to resist sharing this data, forcing investors to take this to the ballot box.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInvestors want more transparency into what Amazon is including in its carbon footprint and why, dollar-for-dollar, Walmart and Target report more emissions than Amazon &#8212; by a long shot,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cAmazon launched its \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.aboutamazon.com\/environment\/the-climate-pledge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Climate Pledge<\/a>\u201d four years ago and invited other companies to commit to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040. On the one hand, Amazon has been a climate leader, but on the other, its refusal to disclose its full carbon footprint, means its pledges could just be greenwashing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although Amazon has not announced a date yet for its 2023 annual general meeting of shareholders, history suggests it will be held near the end of May.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"249\" height=\"140\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About The Green Century Funds<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
