In exchange, investors withdrew the proposal. Native vegetation conversion, or repurposing wild land for agriculture and other uses, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mongabay.com\/2020\/05\/soy-made-the-cerrado-a-breadbasket-climate-change-may-end-that\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">degrades ecosystems such as the Cerrado<\/a> savanna in Brazil that are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlaces like the Cerrado may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they\u2019re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/leslie-samuelrich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, Green Century Funds\u2019 president. \u201cADM\u2019s commitment is an important step toward getting these critical biomes the safeguards they need.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Food &amp; agriculture contributes one-third of global climate emissions<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adm.com\/globalassets\/sustainability\/sustainability-reports\/adm-h2-2021-soy-progress-report-compressed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ADM reported 97% deforestation- and conversion-free volumes for Brazilian soy<\/a> and announced at COP27 a commitment to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tropicalforestalliance.org\/assets\/Agriculture-Sector-Roadmap-January-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conduct a global assessment in 2023<\/a> of the risk of native vegetation conversion to soy production. Green Century\u2019s proposal asked ADM to expand its current plan to include an independently verified commitment to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its global supply chains by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe global food and agriculture industry contributes about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldwildlife.org\/places\/cerrado\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one-third<\/a> of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/annie-sanders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Annie Sanders<\/a>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century Funds. \u201cWe look forward to working with ADM to eliminate native vegetation conversion in its supply chains as soon as possible in South America \u2013 and beyond.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Soy production is a leading cause of native vegetation conversion in South America<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Soy production is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalforestwatch.org\/blog\/commodities\/soy-production-forests-south-america\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leading cause of native vegetation conversion<\/a> in South American biomes and part of a broader decline of South American wilderness. As the world\u2019s most biodiverse savanna, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldwildlife.org\/places\/cerrado\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Cerrado houses 5% of the world\u2019s animals and plants<\/a> including vulnerable species such as jaguars, maned wolves and giant anteaters. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldwildlife.org\/places\/gran-chaco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gran Chaco<\/a> forest between the Cerrado and the Andes Mountains is the second-largest forest in South America, behind only the Amazon rainforest. Agriculture is projected to supplant millions of additional acres of native vegetation in the Gran Chaco by 2030.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cForests are not the only landscapes that need protection. The Cerrado, for example, feeds 8 of 12 of Brazil\u2019s major river basins and three aquifers. Native vegetation clearance has already been linked to decreased rainfall,\u201d said Adam Kanzer, head of stewardship, Americas for BNP Paribas Asset Management. \u201cCurrent policies could lead to very serious near-term consequences for Brazilian agriculture and human health. We commend ADM for agreeing to take a hard look at what it would take to adopt a more holistic approach to its most important South American supply chains.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy signing the COP26 Glasgow deforestation pledge, Robeco has committed to work towards eliminating agricultural-driven deforestation from our investment portfolios by 2025. For many years our engagement has focused on forest biomes such as the Amazon and boreal forests. However, with increasing corporate and legislative action on deforestation, pressures on non-forest biomes such as the Cerrado and Gran Chaco are growing.\u201d says Peter van der Werf, Executive Director Active Ownership at Robeco. \u201cBy strengthening their approach to wider native vegetation conversion, ADM is protecting its license to operate and moving towards a future proof business model, safeguarding their key productive assets: the land and ecosystem services they depend on.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14264\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>About The Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
