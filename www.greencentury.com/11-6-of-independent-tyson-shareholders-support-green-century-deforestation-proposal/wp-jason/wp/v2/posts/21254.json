(EMCOR) has taken the next step in achieving its goal to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. It recently committed to establishing science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets with the highly regarded <a href=\"https:\/\/sciencebasedtargets.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Science Based Targets initiative<\/a>. EMCOR now has 2 years to set a near-term emissions reduction target aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold above which climate change impacts are likely to be severe.<\/p>\n<p>EMCOR is a mechanical and electrical construction services company that conducts building energy audits and installs energy efficiency retrofits to HVAC and lighting systems. EMCOR also designs, builds and maintains alternative energy installations and has the expertise to support solar, wind, fuel-cell, biomass, landfill gas and tidal power generation systems. Such services are key to a society-wide transition to a low-carbon economy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven though achieving a near-term science-based target is ambitious, EMCOR deserves a lot of credit for accepting the challenge,\u201d said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cAs a society, the only way we\u2019re going to cut greenhouse gas emissions to near zero is to create demand for clean energy and energy efficient technologies. EMCOR\u2019s new commitment acknowledges this reality.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transitioning to all-electric vehicles can help EMCOR cut emissions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>EMCOR travels to project sites across the country and uses its fleet of approximately 11,000 service vehicles, including pickup trucks, vans and heavy-duty transport vehicles, to deliver materials to &#8212; and support construction work at &#8212; customer sites. Prior to Green Century\u2019s engagement, EMCOR had begun quantifying its greenhouse gas emissions and learned that the majority of its emissions came from its vast vehicle fleet.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that EMCOR will have to procure low- and zero emission vehicles to meet its new commitment,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cFortunately, Ford, General Motors and Dodge have released or will soon release all-electric models of their iconic pickup trucks. Similarly, new all-electric vans, by Ford and by GM-owned Brightdrop, are just now hitting the market, so there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for EMCOR to incorporate these new models into its fleet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"209\" height=\"118\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><strong>About The Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
