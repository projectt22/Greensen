In 2022, Green Century filed a virtually identical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects\/\">proposal<\/a> asking the company to stop underwriting new coal, oil and methane gas projects. The SEC denied Chubb\u2019s request. Subsequently, the proposal went to a vote at Chubb\u2019s 2022 annual general meeting and garnered the support of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/tallies-announced-for-green-century-climate-proposals-votes-at-the-hartford-and-chubb\/\">19.4% of the shareholder votes cast<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like most U.S. property and casualty insurers, Chubb lags behind its European peers in adopting meaningful exclusions. Despite the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and constraints on fossil fuel supply,<a href=\"https:\/\/global.insure-our-future.com\/worlds-largest-reinsurer-announces-major-new-oil-and-gas-policy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> \u00a0<\/a>a number of European property and casualty insurers now exclude more oil and methane gas development in their fossil fuel underwriting.\u00a0 By contrast, in January 2022, a global NGO insurance campaign identified Chubb as a major underwriter of South American offshore oil and gas drilling projects, providing Brazil\u2019s national oil company coverage for 60% of its general civil liability and 50% of its transport-related risks. This state-owned Brazilian company has the fifth-largest documented oil and gas expansion plans of any oil and gas company in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt boggles the mind to think that an insurance company would willingly create risk for itself and its shareholders by supporting new fossil fuel supply,\u201d said Green Century Funds President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>. \u201cWe have to transition away from fuels that create carbon pollution and drive global warming. And let me be clear: We\u2019re not asking Chubb to summarily cancel existing contracts. We\u2019re asking Chubb to be more forward-thinking about a slice of its business and phase out of underwriting new fossil fuel projects. It\u2019s a low bar to clear considering the existential risk of climate change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/corpfin\/no-action\/14a-8\/gcchubb011323-14a8-incoming.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chubb argued to the SEC<\/a> that Green Century\u2019s proposal should be excluded because it probes too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders, as a group, would not be in a position to make an informed judgment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cChubb\u2019s argument seems to underestimate the intelligence of its shareholders,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger<\/a>. \u201cI\u2019m sure many are able to come to the fairly obvious conclusion that insurance policies enabling new coal, oil and gas supplies are fueling increasingly severe climate change impacts. It\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About The Green Century Funds<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
