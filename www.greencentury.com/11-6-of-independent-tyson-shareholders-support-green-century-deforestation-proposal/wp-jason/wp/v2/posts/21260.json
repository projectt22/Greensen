Chubb declared it will no longer cover oil and gas projects in government-protected conservation areas found in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protectedplanet.net\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">World Database on Protected Areas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Chubb was the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.chubb.com\/2019-07-01-Chubb-Announces-New-Policy-on-Coal-Underwriting-and-Investment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first U.S. insurer<\/a> to adopt any restrictions on underwriting new coal mining, new coal plant construction and operation, and new risks for utilities burning coal. In 2022, Chubb announced it would no longer offer coverage for oil sands projects, either. It is now the first U.S. insurer to announce underwriting restrictions on extraction from conservation areas. In addition, Chubb says it plans to work with oil and gas clients on improving methane leak detection, eliminating non-emergency venting of methane, and reducing emissions from flaring.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe welcome any new policy that will effectively cut emissions in line with what experts tell us we need to do to prevent the worst impacts of climate change,\u201d said Green Century Funds President, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, \u201cBut &#8212; and there\u2019s a big but &#8212; it\u2019s not clear whether Chubb\u2019s new policy aligns its entire book of business with a 1.5 degrees Celsius scenario. We need to see more details to know whether this is an impactful policy or simply a diversion from our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/green-century-files-shareholder-proposals-with-chubb-the-hartford-and-travelers-around-their-support-of-fossil-fuel-projects\/\">shareholder proposal<\/a>, so we invite Chubb to further explain its new policy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Green Century Funds has negotiated with Chubb over the past two years, urging the company to stop underwriting new fossil fuel projects in alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Each year, Green Century has filed a shareholder proposal asking Chubb to commit to phase out underwriting new coal, oil and gas projects. The 2022 proposal received <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/chubb-tries-to-block-green-century-shareholder-proposal-for-second-year-in-a-row\/\">19.4% of the vote<\/a>, a high enough percentage that Green Century could file again this year. Chubb has again appealed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, asking it to block Green Century\u2019s proposal from appearing on this year\u2019s proxy ballot.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDespite Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/insurer-chubb-demands-energy-producers-cut-methane-emissions-for-coverage-52251222\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comments<\/a> that its new policy is science-based, it\u2019s unclear if or how the plan matches up with this fact: Global emissions need to drop nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/en\/climatechange\/net-zero-coalition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50% by 2030<\/a> to avoid the worst effects of climate change,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE\">Andrea Ranger<\/a>. \u201cOur shareholder proposal asks Chubb to take a concrete step forward to phase out underwriting new fossil fuel projects. Let me be clear: This does not rule out underwriting <em>existing<\/em> companies, projects or operations. Some energy companies may actually be developing low-carbon projects and Chubb <em>should<\/em> underwrite those risks. Nevertheless, underwriting new oil and gas supply amplifies medium- and long-term climate risk, which doesn\u2019t add shareholder value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such cri<\/em><em>teria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><em style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-14508 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"227\" height=\"128\" \/><\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
