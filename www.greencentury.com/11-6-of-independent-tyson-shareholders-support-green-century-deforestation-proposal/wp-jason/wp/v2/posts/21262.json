The report evaluates whether manufactures disclose disaggregated data on supply chain greenhouse gas emissions, amounts of recycled metal used in manufacturing, targets to increase recycled metal content by 2030, and targets to procure fossil-free or \u201cgreen\u201d steel and aluminum. GM scored a \u20180\u2019 in all four categories.<\/p>\n<p>Green Century Capital Management filed a shareholder proposal with GM at the close of 2022, pressing the largest U.S. automaker to procure at least 10% fossil-free steel and aluminum by 2030 and to eliminate deforestation linked to its leather and rubber supply chains. Although GM has set a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for its operations and emissions associated with its light-duty vehicles, it has not accounted for supply chain emissions or leather and rubber-associated tropical deforestation in prime sourcing areas such as Africa, southeast Asia or Brazil.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Leadership Board\u2019s findings confirm what Green Century already knew \u2013 that there\u2019s a concerning gap between General Motors\u2019 stated intent to address its supply emissions and its actions. We want action, not just words,\u201d said Green Century Funds President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>. \u201cWhile we strongly support GM\u2019s ambitions to transition its portfolio of light-duty vehicles to zero emissions by 2035, we believe it can do more to facilitate low-carbon solutions for metals production and to ensure that producing rubber and leather for its tires and luxury interiors never results in deforestation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/capabilities\/operations\/our-insights\/making-supply-chain-decarbonization-happen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McKinsey reported<\/a> that value chain emissions, including supply chain and land use change emissions, accounted for 80% of many companies\u2019 carbon footprints. For auto manufacturers, this occurs in several ways. The mining, smelting and manufacturing of metal parts for cars and trucks is highly energy intensive. Also, forest degradation linked to rubber cultivation and raising cattle creates climate-altering emissions. Leading scientists and international NGOs recommend curbing all sources of greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to 1.5\u2070C over preindustrial levels and avert the worst impacts of climate change.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTackling supply chain emissions is critical to achieving meaningful emissions reductions,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger.<\/a> \u201cTwo leading EV manufacturers, Polestar and Rivian*, have jointly released a report telling us that neither switching to 100% battery electric vehicles nor powering that fleet with fossil-free energy will be enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5\u2070C. But, if auto manufacturers aggressively decarbonize their supply chains, then overshooting the 1.5\u2070C target could be prevented.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14264\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"186\" height=\"105\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
