What really is ESG and why should you care?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ESG or ESG data can measure how a company is managing the material, environmental, social, and governance risk factors facing a company. Using ESG data or integrating ESG data into your selection process provides additional screenings for your investments that may affect their performance and risk in various market cycles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as the demand for responsible products grew and Wall Street saw the opportunity to capitalize on this interest, mainstream firms launched products using some applications of this data. Here\u2019s the important part, they implied that using ESG data for your investment would make the world a better place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/graphics\/2021-what-is-esg-investing-msci-ratings-focus-on-corporate-bottom-line\/?sref=Brs3FVmA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomberg report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the authors documented how the perception of ESG data as a tool to ensure responsible corporate behavior isn\u2019t necessarily the case, explaining what ESG does and does not do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the example of a company that uses a high amount of water in its processes. One might assume that a strong or high environmental or ESG score means that the company is managing its reliance on water by implementing systems\u00a0 to protect watersheds or to reduce the company\u2019s consumption of\u00a0 finite water resources.\u00a0 But not so fast.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some companies might reduce their water risk by applying water conservation methods. But alternatively the company might be managing its risks by taking steps that don\u2019t align your environmental values. For example, the company could be buying up water rights from nearby communities. Securing these water rights <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reduce the company\u2019s risk of running out of water and so can merit a strong score on this material risk factor. But this method isn\u2019t a practice that most people would think aligns with their environmental values or is making a positive impact on the world\u2019s growing issue of water scarcity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirty years ago, when the socially and environmentally responsible investing field was starting, the approach <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> focused on the company\u2019s external impact or impact on the greater good or society.\u00a0 A frequently used approach was screening out industries harmful to the environment or people (toxic chemicals), examining corporate governance practices, and examining how companies lobbied on these issues.\u00a0 This approach allowed people to align their values with their investments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But as more individuals became interested in responsible investing, mainstream firms sought to capitalize on this demand and rolled out new products using ESG data. They claimed screening out environmentally harmful or socially objectionable industries was the outdated method and that using ESG data was the modern and improved approach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What was missing from this characterization was the explanation that these two methodologies don\u2019t yield the same results. The ubiquitous pictures of rolling hills, windfarms and serene water that often accompanies ads for products using environmental, social, or governance data seemed to imply that using this data had an impact on the planet that may not be there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investors need data to make decisions and using ESG data can help them evaluate material risks to the companies they are evaluating, which is why so many asset managers now take this information into account and will continue to do so regardless of how others try to politicize its use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help investors make informed decisions, asset managers need to be clear in their communications, compliance teams need to be on guard against marketing that could mislead investors, and marketing and sales teams need to avoid greenwashing their products.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asset owners and investors need to look under the hood of their investments and see if it matches their expectations. There are various tools including screening, ESG data, or community investing that address different issues and deliver different results for the investors and the world and there is no one size fits all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these steps, everyone will be better prepared to answer the question: What is ESG and what is it not?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
