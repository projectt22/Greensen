The proposal seeks full disclosure of Amazon&#8217;s scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, which includes emissions associated with the production and use of third-party products and transportation, waste generation, and business travel. Amazon currently publishes only a portion of its scope 3 emissions.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon competitors Walmart and Target quantify, estimate where needed, and disclose all relevant categories of their scope 3 value chain emissions, as defined by the widely-referenced GHG Protocol. In its argument to the SEC, Amazon claimed that Green Century and Amalgamated Bank\u2019s proposal, which asked it to report on its entire emissions footprint according to Protocol guidelines, constituted micromanagement. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/divisions\/corpfin\/cf-noaction\/14a-8\/2023\/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/divisions\/corpfin\/cf-noaction\/14a-8\/2023\/gccmamazon012023-14a8-incoming.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon failed to emphasize<\/a> in its letter to the SEC that it currently reports by using the Protocol\u2019s definitions for the scopes 1 &#8211; 3 emissions that it does <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.aboutamazon.com\/2021-ghg-verification.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disclose<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Industry experts report that scope 3 emissions often constitute between 70% and 99% of companies\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions footprint, and according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2022\/09\/scope-emissions-climate-greenhouse-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">World Economic Forum<\/a>, \u201cCompanies will need to cut emissions across all three scopes to meet internationally agreed targets on global warming.\u201d By not accounting for its full greenhouse gas footprint, Amazon may be failing to address all emissions related to running its ecommerce, retail stores, and web services. The company may be in danger of failing to meet its ambitious climate goals.<\/p>\n<p>In reaction to the news, Green Century President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a> expressed disappointment, \u201cAmazon has been a leader on climate by aggressively developing wind projects and supporting the roll out of electric vehicle delivery trucks. It\u2019s troubling that Amazon is blocking shareholders from expressing their opinions on the company\u2019s full exposure to climate risk.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, Amazon and the firm, Global Optimism, launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theclimatepledge.com\/us\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Climate Pledge<\/a>, inviting companies across the globe to \u201ccommit to net-zero by 2040 across all emissions scopes.\u201d It is yet unclear the scopes of emissions that Amazon includes in its net-zero by 2040 goal. Walmart and Target report that 97% and\u00a0 95% of their emissions come from scope 3 sources. According to Amazon, its scope 3 emissions represent only 78% of its total emissions &#8211; that is, only for the scope 3 emissions it actually publishes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow are we supposed to assess Amazon\u2019s full climate risk if it\u2019s holding back material information from investors and stakeholders?\u201d questioned Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger<\/a>. \u201cAmazon is undermining other companies\u2019 good faith efforts to disclose upstream, downstream, and operational emissions. As the UN Secretary just quipped, &#8216;Our world needs climate action on all fronts: everything, everywhere, all at once.\u2019 Disclosure and action are key to reaching the world\u2019s climate goals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"127\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
