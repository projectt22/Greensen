Shareholder advocacy is a tool that is used by investors to push a company to report on or change a policy, usually around environmental, social or governance issues. Shareholder advocacy takes the form of discussions, shareholder resolutions, proxy votes and other actions. These are very effective ways to drive change toward sustainability for a company or an industry. Shareholder advocacy can also push laggard companies that need to be held accountable for failing to address risks and push them to catch up to peer companies. Shareholder advocacy for Green Century Funds centers on environmental issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What is Shareholder Advocacy?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shareholder advocates assess the reputational, competitive, regulatory, and legal risks that a company faces and brings these issues to the attention of corporate management. Shareholder advocates lead dialogues with company executives to learn how the company is addressing an issue. If needed, shareholder advocates press for changes through negotiations or by filing a shareholder resolution. For example, Green Century shareholder advocates learned that Costco* did not have any greenhouse gas emissions goals to address the company\u2019s potential climate risk and larger role in the world.\u00a0 Our shareholder advocates held\u00a0 several meetings, filed a shareholder advocacy proposal and won a majority vote on the issue. The upshot is Green Century advocates were successful in getting <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/release-green-century-shareholder-proposal-prompts-costco-commitment-to-set-new-climate-emissions-reduction-targets\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Costco* to adopt greenhouse gas emission goals<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Green Century advocates push for action on today\u2019s most pressing environmental issues, including plastic pollution, animal welfare, reducing carbon emissions and sourcing renewable energy. For us, shareholder advocacy means helping a company reduce its\u2019 material risks while securing changes that improve our air, water, and land. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Who Can Be a Shareholder Advocate?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exactly who can be a shareholder advocate? Typically, a shareholder advocate is an individual or group of investors who try to influence corporate management. An individual who owns stock in a company, provided they meet certain requirements, can engage with a company. More commonly, shareholder advocates work for an asset manager such as a mutual fund or asset owner such as a state pension fund. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Why is Shareholder Advocacy Important?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shareholder advocacy is a very effective way for investors to help change corporate policy concerning environmental or social corporate policies. As investors increasingly become interested in sustainable investing, they want to know if their mutual funds and asset managers have a shareholder engagement or shareholder advocacy program with strong\u00a0 track records.\u00a0 If the shareholder advocacy program is effective, investors see how they can align their values with making a positive impact in the world.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Century\u2019s shareholder advocates have successfully pushed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/statement-coca-cola-announces-refillable-packaging-goal-prompted-by-proposal-from-green-century-and-as-you-sow\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coca-Cola* to reduce its\u2019 plastic use<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/lowes-commits-to-new-protections-for-global-forests-green-century\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lowe\u2019s* to source more sustainably grown timber<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/statement-green-century-shareholder-proposal-results-in-new-jack-in-the-box-animal-welfare-commitment\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jack in the Box to get rid of gestation crates used for pregnant sows<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 Green Century&#8217;s award winning program has helped change companies, supply chains, and industries for more than two decades.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Does Green Century Support Shareholder Advocacy?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Century Funds negotiates with companies to improve their corporate sustainability practices by reducing their reliance on fossil fuels, protecting ocean wildlife from plastic pollution, adopting sustainable agriculture policies and more.
