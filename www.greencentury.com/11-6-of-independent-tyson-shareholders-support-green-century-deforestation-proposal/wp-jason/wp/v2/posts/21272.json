Climate transition plans detail companies&#8217; near- and medium-term strategies and future actions deemed necessary to reaching their greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United Nations describes such plans as an \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/sites\/un2.un.org\/files\/high-level_expert_group_n7b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">essential tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d for building public trust, helping companies align \u201cgovernance and incentive structures, capital expenditures, research and development, skills and human resource development, and public advocacy\u2026\u201d with their targets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressure to plan for and achieve steep emissions cuts comes not only from investors, but from the semiconductor industry itself. The Semiconductor Climate Consortium, which is an initiative of\u00a0 the microelectronics industry group SEMI, urges its members to set net-zero emissions targets and to transparently report progress. Additionally, semiconductor company customers that have net-zero emissions reduction targets, such as Apple,* Google,* and Microsoft,* are increasingly eyeing their chip suppliers as they look to eliminate their upstream emissions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Climate Transition Plans Help Investors Assess Companies\u2019 Progress In Limiting Climate Change<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI believe each company recognizes the value of producing climate transition plans for investors and that their leadership will encourage peers and competitors to do the same,\u201d said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cInvestors increasingly need visibility into companies\u2019 assumptions, opportunities, barriers, and emissions reduction pathways as they move toward fulfilling their emissions reduction targets.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semiconductor chip manufacturing is energy intensive and relies heavily on electricity to power furnaces, manufacturing equipment, and to maintain clean rooms. As a result, companies like Intel, NVIDIA, and ON Semiconductor are looking to source 100% renewable energy for their operations.\u00a0 However, semiconductor manufacturing also uses gases that are essential\u00a0 to completing chip designs, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs). PFCs have a global warming potential that is thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide, and the gases are currently much more difficult to replace with less potent alternatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe semiconductor industry has some very real challenges to overcome in order to secure a path to net-zero emissions,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger, \u201cThe idea of climate transition plans is relatively new, but for Green Century, they couldn\u2019t come quickly enough. The window of time for limiting devastating climate impacts is so narrow; we need to know that companies are planning and doing their part to ensure a livable future.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ranger added, \u201cI want to acknowledge Advanced Micro Devices and ON Semiconductor, especially, for agreeing to create the most comprehensive transition plans I\u2019ve seen yet. All five companies, however, deserve praise for their new commitments.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"234\" height=\"132\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">###<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
