The proposal requests Chubb adopt a policy for the time-bound phase out of underwriting new coal, oil, and gas projects. Green Century<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> filed a similar proposal in 2022, asking for an immediate cessation of underwriting new projects. Chubb challenged last year\u2019s proposal, but, at that time, the SEC ruled the proposal could appear on Chubb\u2019s 2022 ballot.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chubb is the largest publicly-traded property and casualty insurance company and is actively involved in underwriting oil and gas project risks. For example, Chubb has previously underwritten policies for controversial fossil fuel infrastructure projects, such as the Trans Mountain pipeline. A 2022 report exposed Chubb as a major underwriter of liability and transportation risks for offshore oil drilling operations for Petrobras \u2013 Brazil\u2019s national oil company \u2013 which has the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/global.insure-our-future.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fifth largest oil and gas expansion plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of any oil and gas company in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed that Chubb did not want its shareholders to vote on this issue and that the SEC supported Chubb\u2019s argument, claiming that our proposal requires shareholders to \u2018probe too deeply\u2019 into Chubb\u2019s core business. We think shareholders understand insurance is essential for coal, oil and gas companies, and many do not believe increasingly expensive drilling and its associated emissions are good for business,\u201d said Green Century Funds President <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cThat&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve asked Chubb to phase out insurance for new projects that will likely create decades of greenhouse gas\u00a0 emissions. It\u2019s hard to square how Chubb enables carbon pollution while simultaneously issuing policies to protect people\u2019s homes and businesses from the impacts of climate change.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prior to the SEC\u2019s ruling, Chubb had announced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/about.chubb.com\/#:~:text=Chubb%20is%20the%20world&#039;s%20largest,health%20insurance%2C%20reinsurance%20and%20life\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new underwriting criteria<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for oil and gas extraction projects requiring existing clients to reduce methane emissions. Additionally, Chubb said it would no longer provide coverage for oil and gas projects in state- or nationally-designated protected areas and in certain other conservation areas. Green Century Funds welcomed action but also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/statement-chubb-announces-new-policy-to-restrict-its-underwriting-of-oil-and-gas-sector-green-century-seeks-details-on-how-effectively-it-will-reduce-carbon-emissions\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">critiqued the new policy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, indicating that its potential for reducing greenhouse emissions was unclear.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor two years, we have been pressing Chubb to uphold its duty to protect its shareholders and customers from climate risk,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzuqgBhAcEiwAdj5dRqBKNqW_QtBw81NZznef-31krA6MotHYLOK6diqH9QqKLpkzZsGCSxoC-AEQAvD_BwE\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Ranger<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cWe believe helping the fossil fuel industry is completely contrary to its fiduciary and prudential responsibilities. These actions aid and abet an industry that has done the most to contribute to a warming planet. Insurers like Chubb have to show more leadership because they are on the front lines of experiencing climate risk.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"245\" height=\"138\" \/><\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">###<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
