(UPS) showed lower support for a Green Century\u00b0 and Trillium Asset Management proposal asking the company to adopt an independently verified science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. Votes in favor reached 20%. By comparison, the same proposal filed last year by Green Century, Trillium, and a third investor achieved <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/statement-green-century-reacts-to-vote-at-ups-on-climate-shareholder-proposal\/\">twenty-eight percent of votes cast in favor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, UPS announced a goal to become <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edie.net\/ups-aims-to-become-carbon-neutral-by-2050\/#:~:text=Logistics%20giant%20UPS%20has%20unveiled,its%20global%20operations%20by%202050.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">carbon neutral by 2050<\/a> for emissions related to its direct operations, e.g. related to package delivery and air freight. Its goal also covers UPS\u2019s indirect emissions, i.e. from third parties, such as the emissions from air freight provided by its vendors or emissions associated with manufacturing the goods that UPS uses, like sorting equipment. Nevertheless, Green Century remains concerned the company\u2019s commitment may be an empty promise because its goal has not been verified by an independent third party. Nor is it clear whether UPS\u2019s intent to reduce its direct and indirect emissions will align with limiting its greenhouse gas emissions to 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise. Climate experts strongly recommend that the world not exceed this temperature in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<\/p>\n<p>By contrast, other companies in the transportation sector, such as passenger airlines Delta, American, Air France, Iberia, KLM, and United have all committed to set science-based targets (SBTs) via Science Based Targets initiative, a global standard setting body and verifier of SBTs. For its land transportation needs, UPS has turned to alternative fuels, such as renewable natural gas (RNG). However, some believe that the production and consumption of RNG could steer efforts away from the electrification of delivery fleets. Unlike UPS, its competitors, Fedex and Amazon, have committed to purchasing 50% EV delivery trucks by 2025 and 100% by 2030 and 100,000 EV trucks by 2030, respectively.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong> said: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe filed the shareholder proposal for a second year in a row because we believe UPS\u2019s sustainability efforts are not delivering for us, and we felt it was important to bring our concerns in front of all shareholders,\u201d Samuelrich said. \u201cRegardless of the vote, it is our opinion that UPS\u2019s plans for emissions reductions need to be science-based and verified by credible third parties.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">\u00a0Andrea Ranger<\/a>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century Funds, added: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cCutting emissions as swiftly and deeply as possible makes sense especially for transportation and logistics companies.\u00a0 Climate change is contributing to severe weather that will very likely threaten UPS\u2019 operations and profitability,\u201d Ranger said. \u201cJust last summer,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/08\/20\/business\/ups-postal-workers-heat-stroke-deaths.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> brutal heat waves sent UPS drivers to the hospital<\/a> and, tragically, caused several deaths.
