Specifically, investors urge intensive users of plastic packaging \u2013 such as consumer goods companies and grocery retailers from Kellogg* to Costco* \u2013 to drastically reduce single-use plastic packaging, implement packaging reuse systems, phase out hazardous chemicals in plastics, and advocate for policies supporting these actions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe plastics life cycle not only poses a grave and growing threat to our environment, but the financial burden on society from plastic pollution exceeds $100 billion per year,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, President of Green Century Funds. \u201cNo convenience is worth those costs.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Companies Need to Step Up to Solve the Plastics Problem<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The damage caused to the environment from plastics is clear. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2023\/mar\/08\/plastic-particles-oceans-marine-pollution-production\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Between 75 and 199 million<\/a> tonnes of plastics have leaked into the ocean, and the total greenhouse gas emissions from single-use plastics in 2021 were equivalent to the <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.minderoo.org\/content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/04205527\/Plastic-Waste-Makers-Index-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">annual emissions of the United Kingdom<\/a>. Yet, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/packagingeurope.com\/news\/progress-report-by-ellen-macarthur-foundation-casts-doubt-on-business-full-transition-into-reusable-recyclable-or-compostable-packaging-by-2025\/9009.article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ellen MacArthur Foundation<\/a>, most companies will \u2018almost certainly\u2019 miss their existing plastics reduction targets, increasing their use of single-use plastic packaging overall and failing to demonstrate credible and ambitious plans for reuse.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInvestors are sending a clear signal that companies must urgently address their contribution to the plastic problem,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Annie Sanders<\/a>, Director of Shareholder Advocacy at Green Century Capital Management. \u201cWith increased regulation, litigation, and changing consumer preferences around plastics, it\u2019s in companies\u2019 best interests to meaningfully address the very real financial risks posed by this crisis.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The investor letter asks companies to significantly reduce material consumption, eliminate single-use packaging and scale up reusable packaging systems, among other actions. The letter also calls for companies to publicly support \u2013 rather than lobby against \u2013 ambitious policy on plastic reduction, including the Global Plastics Treaty and the EU\u2019s Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR). A <a href=\"https:\/\/influencemap.org\/report\/The-Consumer-Products-Sector-and-the-EU-s-Circular-Economy-Policy-for-Packaging-Waste-21189\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent analysis<\/a> showed that lobbying efforts by industry associations already managed to considerably weaken some of the measures.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>About The Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
