Green Century filed the proposals in December requesting that the companies phase out underwriting new fossil fuel projects in line with the Paris Agreement\u2019s aim to limit global warming to 1.5\u2103 over pre-industrial temperatures.<\/p>\n<p>Green Century\u2019s proposals raise concerns that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thehartford.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hartford<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.travelers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Travelers<\/a> are exposed to climate risk. Both companies underwrite policies meant to protect customers\u2019 homes and businesses from the impacts of climate-driven catastrophes while simultaneously underwriting policies for the fossil fuel industry, whose emissions amplify the effects of those catastrophes.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInsurers seem to think developing more gas and oil will somehow ease us into a clean energy transition, but developing new wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure is fundamentally incompatible with protecting people and the planet,\u201d said Green Century Funds President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>. \u201cInsurance should be about protection, not enabling systemic threats like climate change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Net-zero goals and insuring new renewables projects are not enough<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While both The Hartford and Travelers have adopted partial underwriting exclusions on insuring thermal coal mining, coal plant construction and operation, and tar sands-related risks, neither company has agreed to limit underwriting new oil and gas projects, even in ecologically-sensitive areas like the Arctic. U.S. insurer Chubb*, the largest publicly-traded commercial property and casualty insurer in the world, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.chubb.com\/2023-03-22-Chubb-Announces-New-Climate-and-Conservation-Focused-Underwriting-Standards-for-Oil-and-Gas-Extraction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> in March that it will no longer underwrite oil and gas extraction projects in government-protected conservation areas and that it will press existing clients to cut methane leaks and emissions from flaring.<\/p>\n<p>Although The Hartford set a <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.thehartford.com\/newsroom-home\/news-releases\/news-releases-details\/2022\/The-Hartford-Announces-Goal-Of-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-For-All-Operations-By-2050\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goal<\/a> to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across its full range of operations, the company has not announced plans to address how its underwriting strategies support its net-zero commitment. Travelers has neither set a net-zero goal nor has it addressed the incongruency of insuring fossil fuel development with protecting its customers from severe weather enhanced by a warming climate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBoth The Hartford and Travelers are insuring new renewable energy projects, and we applaud that,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger<\/a>. \u201cBut developing more renewables is only half the answer. Climate experts tell us that the other half is giving up extracting and burning even more oil and gas. For an industry that relies on science, I hope insurers will extract new oil and gas projects from their underwriting portfolios.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14468\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-1-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"230\" height=\"130\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
