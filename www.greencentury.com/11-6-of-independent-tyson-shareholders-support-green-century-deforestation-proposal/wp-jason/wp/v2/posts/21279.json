Green Century filed the same proposal seeking underwriting restrictions on fossil fuel projects at peer company, Travelers, whose annual meeting of shareholders will be held on May 24th.<\/p>\n<p>Green Century\u2019s proposals were prompted by reports authored by the\u00a0 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \u00a0and the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicating how expanding fossil fuel supply is likely to push the world beyond the recommended limit of a 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise. The IPCC explicitly reports that exceeding the 1.5\u00b0C limit will likely result in dangerous physical risks, and, in some cases, irreversible natural resource damage.<\/p>\n<p>While The Hartford did adopt partial underwriting exclusions for insuring thermal coal mining, coal plant construction and operation, and tar sands-related risks in 2019, it hasn\u2019t extended its exclusions beyond the most heavily-polluting fuels &#8211; even when\u00a0 climate experts say use of fossil fuels must dramatically decline. In 2022, the company adopted a goal to reach <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.thehartford.com\/newsroom-home\/news-releases\/news-releases-details\/2022\/The-Hartford-Announces-Goal-Of-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-For-All-Operations-By-2050\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">net-zero emissions by 2050<\/a>, but has yet to launch new initiatives in support of its goal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong> said: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless of the vote outcome, Green Century will continue to press The Hartford to fully address its climate risk. Despite its existing exclusions and its net-zero by 2050 goal, we\u2019d like to see The Hartford extend its underwriting exclusions to other dirty fossil fuels, including new oil and gas projects. Insurance companies have a critical role to play in steering us toward a low-carbon economy, but supporting new oil and gas wells, pipelines, and transportation infrastructure will likely lock us into carbon emissions that we simply can\u2019t afford.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Andrea Ranger<\/strong><\/a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cCovering the liability and casualty risks of new oil and gas projects is antithetical to protecting the rest of The Hartford\u2019s clients from climate risk. In light of the company\u2019s net-zero goal, I believe Green Century Funds\u2019 proposal is a reasonable request to phase out underwriting new risks for an industry that\u2019s contributed the most to climate change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"232\" height=\"131\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
