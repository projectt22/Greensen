Impact investing is most commonly used to describe investment in privately held companies<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that is done both for monetary gain and to benefit the environment and society, such as building a well and water transportation system in a remote village.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What is Sustainable Investing<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sustainable investing is not a regulated term so many asset managers, mutual funds and ETF\u2019s may use it to describe their methods of investing. The key is to understand what each asset manager defines as sustainable and to see if it matches your personal definition.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Green Century Funds, we believe that sustainable investing starts with avoiding the industries and companies that you don\u2019t want to support. This is also called screening. By beginning in this way, you can align your investments with your values.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>What is Impact Investing<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impact investing is mainly used to describe investing in a private company.\u00a0 Typically, this company is in the start-up phase or early stages and the products or services address a social or environmental problem.\u00a0 This type of investing is typically done by institutions or high net worth individuals. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Sustainable Investing vs Impact Investing<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sustainable investing and impact investing may both be ways that you can invest with your values and make an impact. It depends on how the asset manager is defining both of these terms.\u00a0 Green Century Funds believes that sustainable investing means screening out industries, such as tobacco and fossil fuels, that are environmentally harmful. Green Century Funds are available to individuals and institutions. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Impact investing typically is done by<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a private company and is not as accessible to as many people since investments are not made in companies listed on a stock exchange.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Invest with Green Century Funds<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than 30 years ago, Green Century Funds were founded by a group of environmental and public health nonprofit organizations. We are one of the first fossil fuel free mutual funds and help people save for their futures without comprising their values.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since then, Green Century Funds has grown into a leader in the sustainable investing fields. We provide mutual funds for individuals and institutions to keep their money out of environmentally harmful industries. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you would like to learn more about Green Century Funds,\u00a0 please visit our website or contact us at 1-800-934-7336, at <\/span><a href=\"mailto:info@greencentury.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">info@greencentury.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 or through our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> page.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
