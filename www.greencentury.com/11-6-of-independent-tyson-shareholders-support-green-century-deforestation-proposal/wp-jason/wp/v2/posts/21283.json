The proposal goes to a vote on Thursday, May 25.<\/p>\n<p>The Sisters had previously pressed McDonald\u2019s to engage its pork and beef suppliers to phase out use of the types of antibiotics on their animals that people also use. In 2018, the Sisters filed a similar proposal and withdrew it in exchange for McDonald\u2019s promise to announce reduction targets by 2020. McDonald\u2019s failed to meet its promise.<\/p>\n<p>Administering low doses of antibiotics in food and water can spur development of \u2018superbugs\u2019 in farm animals and create bacteria so resistant to treatment that even the most potent antibiotics can fail to stop the disease. There are a handful of transmission pathways for antibiotic-resistant bacteria that allow them to jump from farm animals to humans. Infection can happen through handling bacteria-laden meat from the supermarket, drinking water polluted by farm runoff, and direct contact with animals by farm workers and meat processors. In 2021, the United Nations announced that we may soon reach a <a href=\"https:\/\/news.un.org\/en\/story\/2021\/11\/1106472\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u2018tipping point\u2019<\/a> when antimicrobial resistance becomes the leading cause of death \u2013 surpassing heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>McDonald\u2019s new <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.mcdonalds.com\/content\/dam\/sites\/corp\/nfl\/pdf\/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">responsible use policy<\/a> encourages producers and veterinary professionals, among others, to \u201cshare responsibility for proactively developing and implementing effective best management strategies to reduce, and where possible eliminate, the need for [medically-important] antibiotic use.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, the policy falls short of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment\/\">proposal\u2019s request<\/a>. Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters had asked McDonald\u2019s address use of antibiotics in its pork as well as beef supply chains. Further, the policy does not address the need for elimination targets, timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, or guidelines for enforcement when suppliers fail to meet McDonald\u2019s guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe upcoming vote is an opportunity for shareholders to assess the gap between what McDonald\u2019s had stated it would do in the past to its new responsible use policy,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, President of Green Century Funds. \u201cIn 2018, McDonald\u2019s promised the nuns that it would announce targets by the end of 2020. It reneged and provided a responsible use policy that has no teeth. In my opinion, it appears to be more aspirational than actionable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/?gad=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwpayjBhAnEiwA-7ena-wQsh1iexQ_IfTDHCbtm-DBeBJQ3GgcrVM4baauc_4PFqVHWvB2FxoCBRoQAvD_BwE\"> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"238\" height=\"134\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
