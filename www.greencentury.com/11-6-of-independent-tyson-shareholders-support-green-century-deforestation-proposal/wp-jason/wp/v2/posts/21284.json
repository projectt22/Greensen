Votes cast in favor reached <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/ix?doc=\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0000086312\/000110465923064998\/tm2316995d1_8k.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8.8%<\/a>, less than the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/votes-on-green-century-proposal-at-travelers-concludes-series-of-filings-at-major-insurers\/\">2022 vote outcome of 13.2%<\/a> for a similar Green Century proposal. Green Century filed the same proposal seeking underwriting restrictions on fossil fuel projects at a peer company, The Hartford*, earning 8.8% of the vote on May 17th.<\/p>\n<p>Green Century\u2019s proposals were prompted by concerns that Travelers\u2019 underwriting strategies were not clearly aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. Global climate and energy experts at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u00a0 and the International Energy Agency (IEA) assert that expanding fossil fuel supply will likely push the world beyond the recommended limit of a 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise. The IPCC reports explicitly that exceeding the 1.5\u00b0C limit will likely result in dangerous physical risks, and, in some cases, irreversible natural resource damage.<\/p>\n<p>While U.S. insurers, <a href=\"https:\/\/about.chubb.com\/citizenship\/environment\/coal-policy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chubb*<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.thehartford.com\/newsroom-home\/news-releases\/news-releases-details\/2019\/The-Hartford-Announces-Its-Policy-On-Insuring-Investing-In-Coal-Tar-Sands\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hartford<\/a>, announced partial underwriting exclusions on insuring thermal coal mining and coal plant construction and operation in 2019, it took Travelers an extra two years to make a <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.travelers.com\/iw-documents\/sustainability\/coal-tar-sands-policy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">similar commitment<\/a>. Additionally, it has yet to extend its exclusions to contractors, equipment or projects that support the development of new oil and gas wells, pipelines, and related fossil fuel infrastructure, even as\u00a0 climate experts declare the use of fossil fuels must dramatically decline.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong> said: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless of the vote, it&#8217;s important to keep this issue front and center for Travelers. We see no reason why it should enable new oil and gas supply in the face of the dire need to transition to a low-carbon economy.\u00a0 To its credit, Travelers has already started down the right path by underwriting new renewable energy projects, including offshore wind construction. However, it still needs to detour from the path of insuring the expansion of fossil fuels.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Andrea Ranger<\/strong><\/a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cCovering the liability and casualty risks for owners, contractors, and equipment that will allow new methane gas, a.ka. \u201cnatural\u201d gas, to flow or new oil for gasoline will only lock us into carbon emissions for years to come. In my view, Travelers has a duty not only to its shareholders, but to stakeholders in general, to pivot from an industry that\u2019s contributed the most to climate change.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14468\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-1-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"243\" height=\"137\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
