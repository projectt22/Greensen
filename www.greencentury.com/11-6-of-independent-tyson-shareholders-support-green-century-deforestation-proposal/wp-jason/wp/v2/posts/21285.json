McDonald\u2019s published the vote tally on Thursday which showed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/ix?doc=\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/63908\/000006390823000059\/mcd-20230525.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">16.6% of votes cast<\/a> were in favor of the proposal.<\/p>\n<p>In its opposition statement, McDonald\u2019s acknowledges that antimicrobial resistance \u201cis a critical global public health issue that we believe we and our suppliers have a responsibility to help address.\u201d The term antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often used interchangeably with antibiotic resistance, but can also describe non-bacterial resistant diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies antimicrobial resistance as a global public health crisis that threatens to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/media\/releases\/2022\/s0712-Antimicrobial-Resistance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reverse medical progress<\/a>, and the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies antimicrobial resistance as \u201cone of the top <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/antimicrobial-resistance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10 global public health threats<\/a> facing humanity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although McDonald\u2019s first publicized that it would address antibiotic resistance in its food animal supply chain in 2003, it didn\u2019t set reduction targets until 2017, which were narrowly focused on its chicken supply chain. Further, the targets aimed to eliminate only the antibiotics that are highly critical to medicine, failing to protect a wide range of other important antibiotics that humans use to fight infections.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/statement-mcdonalds-takes-step-back-from-antibiotics-reduction-goal-green-century-files-shareholder-proposal-asking-for-reinstatement-of-original-commitment\/\">proposal<\/a> filed by Green Century and the Benedictine Sisters asked McDonald\u2019s to establish a policy that would not only eliminate routine use of all medically important human antibiotics in its pork and beef supply chains, but push the company to establish timelines, metrics for measuring implementation, third-party verification, and guidelines for enforcement should suppliers fail to meet McDonald\u2019s targets.<\/p>\n<p>In December 2022, McDonald\u2019s did <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.mcdonalds.com\/content\/dam\/sites\/corp\/nfl\/pdf\/McDonalds_Beef_and_Dairy%20_Antibiotic_Policy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announce<\/a> reduction, but not elimination, targets that are limited to its beef supply chain in its top 10 markets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong> said:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cMcDonald\u2019s shareholders have signaled that they want to hold McDonald\u2019s responsible for not living up to its commitments, especially when it comes to animal welfare and protecting human health. We\u2019ll continue to work with the company, but we won\u2019t be satisfied until it takes steps necessary to protect the effectiveness of antibiotics, which are crucial to public health. We\u2019re looking for both action and accountability on its part.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Andrea Ranger<\/strong><\/a><strong>, Green Century Shareholder Advocate, stated:\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cMcDonald\u2019s is the largest fast food restaurant in the world. As such, it has the influence to change the way food animals are raised and has the responsibility to protect public health from malicious germs which include dangerous bacteria. When I bite into a Big Mac, I want to know that the beef was sourced responsibly and that it was raised without using antibiotics that I, and society in general, need to stay healthy and whole.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"261\" height=\"147\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
