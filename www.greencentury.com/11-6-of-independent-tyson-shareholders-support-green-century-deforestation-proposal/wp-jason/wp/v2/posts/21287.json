The proposal, which asks Mondel\u0113z to disclose interim targets for achieving its goal to source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025, captured <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/ix?doc=\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1103982\/000110398223000025\/mdlz-20230517.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9.8% of the total vote<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Demand for cage-free eggs, and the supply to match it, has grown dramatically in the U.S. and European Union in recent years \u2013driven by consumer awareness of and desire for humanely-raised animal proteins as well as government pressure on manufacturers to switch to producing cage-free eggs. The term \u201ccage-free\u201d was coined in response to farmers\u2019 use of \u201cbattery cages,\u201d where hens are housed in spaces that are smaller than the size of a piece of printer paper.<\/p>\n<p>Mondel\u0113z first announced in 2016 that it would source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025. However, recent company disclosures of current sourcing volumes indicate that it is unlikely to meet its goal, which prompted the Green Century proposal. In recent years, excluding its Russian and Ukrainian egg markets, Mondel\u0113z sourced cage-free eggs at a rate of 27% in 2020, 39% in 2021, and 43% in 2022. Extrapolating from its current progress, Mondel\u0113z would achieve a sourcing rate of only 59% by the end of 2025, far short of its original ambition.<\/p>\n<p>However, Mondel\u0113z peers, General Mills and Conagra, disclose their planned progressions toward their global cage-free egg targets and are further along in achieving their goals than Mondel\u0113z. Further, Target and a wide range of quick service food retailers including Jack in the Box, Denny\u2019s, Bloomin\u2019 Brands (the parent of Olive Garden) have also disclosed similar cage-free egg glide paths to their shareholders.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Green Century Funds President <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong> responded to the vote result by saying: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\u201cWhile we had hoped for greater support for our proposal, this is the first year we\u2019ve brought this issue of cage-free egg goals to Mondel\u0113z shareholders for a vote. Without publishing a clear path for achieving its 2050 cage-free egg sourcing goal, Mondel\u0113z may be inviting unnecessary risk by being seen as not living up to its obligations. This is especially true because we\u2019re talking about a sensitive animal welfare issue that has quite a bit of public support.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><strong>Andrea Ranger<\/strong><\/a><strong>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century commented: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cDisclosure is central to investor decision making, but Mondel\u0113z has told us that disclosing interim targets for its 100% cage-free egg by 2050 goal would be \u201cburdensome, unnecessary\u2026. and could generate confusion among our stakeholders.\u201d Given that it\u2019s now 2023 and Mondel\u0113z committed to reach its goal in 2025, one has to ask, does it really have a plan? If so, why wouldn\u2019t it share it with investors?\u00a0 For the sake of its investors, customers, and the health of the animals in its supply chain, I hope it does and it will.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/invest-with-us\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"144\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
