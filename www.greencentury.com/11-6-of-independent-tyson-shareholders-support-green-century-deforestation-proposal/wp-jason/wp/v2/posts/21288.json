For example, the world\u2019s auto manufacturers consumed 18% and 11% of global aluminum and steel production respectively, according to tallies completed in 2019. Globally, manufacturing steel and aluminum creates billions of tons of carbon dioxide pollution annually, or about 13% of total global GHG emissions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, the leather and rubber that GM sources for its car seats and tires, may be associated with deforestation and land clearance. In Brazil, a country considered a major source of leather for U.S. auto manufacturers, raising cattle causes nearly 70% of the country&#8217;s deforestation. The automobile industry is also the biggest consumer of natural rubber, and rubber tree cultivation is a leading driver of deforestation in Southeast Asia and West Africa.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite GM\u2019s recent commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, the company does not yet disclose the emissions associated with these key materials, nor does it offer concrete strategies for reducing those emissions. Additionally, GM has yet to set a zero-deforestation target \u2013 a commitment that would prevent land clearing for cattle pasture or rubber tree plantations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><b>All in on EVs by 2035 Not Enough to Limit Climate Change<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a 2023 report published by Rivian and Polestar, auto manufacturers need to act quickly to reduce supply chain emissions in line with limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The report <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">notes that even with a transition to battery electric vehicles and using 100% fossil-free energy to power them, auto manufacturers should address supply chain emissions to reach this goal. Thus, GM\u2019s commitment to 100% sales of EVs by 2035 may not be enough to sufficiently mitigate its climate impact.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cGM has made remarkable strides to reduce its environmental footprint, but it needs to focus its attention on its supply chain issues,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Ranger<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cGM should act quickly and holistically since its footprint is expansive and there\u2019s little time for delay if we&#8217;re to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">###<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
