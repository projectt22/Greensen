Green Century\u00b0 received a notable 21% of the vote in favor of its shareholder proposal, which asks the company to adopt science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. The proposal additionally asks the company to set goals for sourcing more renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency in its operations, and procuring zero-emission vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>To implement science-based targets, the company would have to reduce its direct, operational emissions and its indirect emissions including from timber harvested for the lumber it sells. Over <a href=\"https:\/\/sciencebasedtargets.org\/companies-taking-action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5000 companies<\/a>, including competitors <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.lowes.com\/newsroom\/stories\/fresh-thinking\/lowes-science-based-net-zero-target-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lowe\u2019s<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.homedepot.com\/news\/sustainability\/home-depot-reduced-carbon-emissions-more-127000-metric-tons-2020-commits-100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Home Depot<\/a>, have committed to working with the Science Based Targets initiative, and nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldwildlife.org\/stories\/fortune-500-companies-are-acting-on-the-climate-crisis-but-is-it-enough\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">60%<\/a> of all Fortune 500 companies have set some kind of climate change reduction target.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the vote, Green Century Funds President, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a> said:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLast year, we filed a nearly identical proposal at Builders asking for reduction targets which received a resounding \u2018yes&#8217; vote from investors &#8211; but Builders took almost no action. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net\/CIK-0001316835\/579d09c7-0f03-4884-baa0-f9a54cd7af4e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relies heavily on timber<\/a>, which comes from forests that are significantly threatened by climate change. We believe management needs to start taking this risk seriously by measuring, disclosing, and setting reduction targets for its Scope 3 supply chain emissions.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>Green Century Engaged with Builders FirstSource to Set First Emissions Reduction Targets<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Douglass Guernsey<\/a>, shareholder advocate at Green Century added:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the 11th hour, Builders disclosed its <a href=\"https:\/\/s202.q4cdn.com\/867695273\/files\/doc_downloads\/esg\/Builders-FirstSource_2023-CSR-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scope 1 and 2 emissions<\/a>, which cover the direct emissions from its operations, and stated it will set emissions reduction targets for both these categories in 2025.
