Following the Green Century engagement, the company has now agreed to annually disclose its criteria, approach, and portfolio, including details on project purchases and any relevant certifications related to its purchases of carbon offsets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite earlier commitments and a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/www.google.com\/en\/\/green\/pdfs\/google-carbon-offsets.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">white paper<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> detailing its strategy for buying \u201chigh-quality carbon offsets,\u201d which are known for longevity and verifiability, Alphabet\u2019s full disclosure in 2022 fell short. In a single sentence in its <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">annual environmental report<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the company vaguely stated \u201c[We] plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relying on carbon offsets to neutralize emissions is currently an area of intense debate. Some academics and NGOs are urging potential buyers to be cautious as research about how different projects absorb carbon, methodology for measuring offsets, and ability to verify the durability of the offsets evolve.\u00a0 At minimum, more robust disclosure may be advised, and the agreement secured by Green Century should help investors better assess\u00a0 Alphabet\u2019s carbon offset purchases.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m pleased that Alphabet sees the value in revisiting its carbon offsets disclosure policy,\u201d said Green Century Funds President <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cGreen Century, and I expect many, many investors, value insight into how Alphabet is managing its climate risk.\u00a0 I believe embracing transparency will only help it select offsets wisely and avoid the greenwashing label.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has weighed in on the issue. In its proposed climate rule, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/files\/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the SEC expresses an interest in learning how companies use carbon offsets to reach their climate-related goals, and the regulator may require companies to disclose their carbon reductions represented by these offsets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAlphabet is a leader in many respects &#8211; the amount of renewable energy it procures, the energy efficiency it incorporates, and its ability to maintain carbon neutrality. Becoming a leader in carbon offsets seems like a natural step forward,\u201d added Shareholder Advocate <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Andrea Ranger<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cI think our proposal was a wake up call for Alphabet. Investors like us are analyzing corporate climate commitments very closely, and we want to see that claims of emissions reductions using offsets are actually true.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"263\" height=\"148\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0###<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
