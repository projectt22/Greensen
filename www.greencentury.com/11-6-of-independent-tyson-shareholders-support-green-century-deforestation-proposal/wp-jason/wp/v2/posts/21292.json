That\u2019s why Green Century\u2019s advocates work to convince companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect forests, source renewable energy and more. But as wildfires, floods and extreme temperatures have become more common and climate risk has grown for businesses, we\u2019ve focused on another key driver of the climate crisis: the insurance industry.<\/p>\n<p>Oil and gas corporations need insurance to move forward with fossil fuel exploration and extraction. By refusing to cover these environmentally harmful projects, insurance companies could play a positive role in addressing climate change and avoid significant climate risk: global insured losses from natural disasters last year were estimated at $132 billion, making 2022 the fifth costliest year for insurers on record.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_17513\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-17513\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-17513\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/20230524_121438-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-17513\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger poses outside Travelers\u2019 annual meeting before presenting Green Century Funds\u2019 proposal to phase out coverage of new fossil fuel projects.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>While some European companies have stated they will no longer insure certain types of new oil and gas projects, the U.S. insurance industry has made no such moves. In fact, as U.S. insurers continue to cover major drivers of the climate crisis, they\u2019re sticking customers with the costly consequences: State Farm,* the largest homeowner insurance company in California, announced last month that it would stop selling coverage to homeowners \u2013 not just in wildfire zones, but everywhere in the state.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To convince U.S. insurers to keep up with evolving global standards and avoid future losses associated with a warming planet, Green Century led a shareholder advocacy program this year with three of the world\u2019s largest insurers: Chubb*, The Hartford*, and Travelers,* asking each company to phase out the underwriting of new fossil fuel projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our dialogues with each company were informative, but none agreed to phase out new fossil fuel projects. The Green Century Funds filed shareholder resolutions with the companies so that shareholders could weigh in on whether insurers should continue to underwrite some of the activities most directly responsible for warming our planet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no climate-related proposals at insurance companies won majority support this shareholder season, Green Century helped the issue gain widespread <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/fossil-fuel-insurance-is-turning-into-a-climate-change-fight-whats-at-stake-a3e09ce5\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">visibility<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, increased board-level discussion, and heightened investor awareness.
