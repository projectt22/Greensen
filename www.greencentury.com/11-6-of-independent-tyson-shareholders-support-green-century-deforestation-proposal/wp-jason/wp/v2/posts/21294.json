Green Century had approached the newspaper with concerns about the company\u2019s lack of goals for cutting emissions associated with global warming.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, The Times\u2019 reporters have written extensively about the impacts of climate change. In 2020, the company started hosting an event series called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/article\/netting-zero.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Netting Zero<\/a>,\u201d featuring discussions by journalists and climate experts on how to have net-zero emissions in the future. However, at that time, The Times had not set or disclosed its own goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis new commitment by The Times is news that\u2019s fit to print &#8212; and just in time,\u201d said Green Century Funds President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>. \u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just issued a <a href=\"https:\/\/news.un.org\/en\/story\/2023\/03\/1134777\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">synthesis report<\/a> calling for \u2018deep, rapid, and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions,\u2019 and, in response,\u00a0 U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, urged immediate action to reduce emissions, saying, \u2018the <a href=\"https:\/\/press.un.org\/en\/2023\/sgsm21730.doc.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">climate time-bomb is ticking<\/a>.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytco.com\/press\/the-new-york-times-company-announces-pledge-for-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2030\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement,<\/a> The Times noted that it had begun to inventory its scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and that it would publish its results sometime in 2023. Additionally, The Times said it intends to use its building spaces more efficiently, consume resources responsibly and cut greenhouse gas emissions. It also intends to electrify its delivery fleet, update its New York City headquarters to be more sustainable by cutting waste, and source paper from responsibly managed natural resources.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCommitting to reduce its carbon footprint and overall environmental impact is a first step toward putting The New York Times in line with its global peers, including <a href=\"https:\/\/uploads.guim.co.uk\/2021\/08\/25\/Positive_Impact_Sustainability_Report_1920.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Guardian<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/newscorp.com\/news-corp-sustainability\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Wall Street Journal<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/aboutus.ft.com\/company\/sustainability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Financial Times<\/a>,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Andrea Ranger<\/a>.\u00a0\u201cGiven The Times\u2019 international prominence and the intense public scrutiny it receives, we believe that by implementing rigorous policies, targets and programs to reduce the company\u2019s climate risk, it will help avoid reputational risk.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The other media outlets mentioned above have set or committed to set near-term science-based targets for their scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions with the Science Based Targets initiative that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In addition, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times have committed to reduce at least a portion of their scope 3 emissions by 2030.<\/p>\n<p><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button.png\"><strong><em> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-14458\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"135\" \/><\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>###<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
