The company\u2019s continued commitment is a win for consumer rights and efforts to combat e-waste and came after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/\">Green Century Funds<\/a>\u00b0, a leading environmentally responsible family of mutual funds, advocated for increasing sustainable business practices at the company.<\/p>\n<p>Green Century initiated discussions with Apple in 2021 and submitted a shareholder proposal later that year asking the company to consider the environmental and social benefits of making its devices more easily repairable by consumers and independent repair shops.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Green Century Advocacy Creates Long-Term Impact for the Environment <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Through a series of collaborative meetings, Green Century provided Apple with compelling evidence on the positive environmental implications of allowing customers to repair instead of replacing their products. Repairs extend the life of products, help reduce electronic and plastic waste, promote a more circular economy, and aligns Apple\u2019s policy on the issue with its own sustainability goals and commitments.<\/p>\n<p>Green Century\u2019s efforts helped to culminate in Apple announcing for the first time in 2021 that it would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products. Green Century withdrew its shareholder proposal in return for Apple\u2019s commitments.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTrue to its slogan, Apple is \u201cThinking Different\u201d by helping to reduce electronic waste and helping customers hold on to their products longer. Green Century is proud to have played a role in Apple&#8217;s evolving support for Right to Repair and hope that their leadership moves its competitors to follow suit,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds.<\/p>\n<p>Apple and other technology companies traditionally have lobbied against Right to Repair legislation, so the announcement of its expanded repair commitments carries substantial weight in industry discussions.
