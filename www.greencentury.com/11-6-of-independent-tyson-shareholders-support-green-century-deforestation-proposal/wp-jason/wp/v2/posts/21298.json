I work on our insurance campaign pressing insurance companies to stop offering coverage for new fossil fuel projects. Not surprisingly, these insurers are not interested in changing their insurance strategies.<\/p>\n<p>During the year, shareholder advocates research the environmental risks that companies are exposed to or, worse yet, they create. And, we then communicate with companies by writing, calls, and face-to-face dialogue. When we can\u2019t agree on a course of action, we present our concerns to fellow shareholders at companies\u2019 annual meetings.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-17793 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/20230524_080651-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to the Travelers\u2019* annual meeting in Hartford, CT. After I presented Green Century\u2019s Funds\u2019 shareholder proposal, I went on a treasure hunt to meet the company\u2019s board of directors and CEO, Alan Schnitzer. Security guards were blocking my path to the board, but I managed to meet three directors. I was thrilled.<\/p>\n<p>I also asked to speak to Travelers\u2019 CEO Alan Schnitzer, but he was busy. Then something special happened. As I reached my car to go home, Alan Schnitzer called me. I was sure it was a prank. It wasn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>We exchanged pleasantries, but the conversation steered toward Green Century Funds\u2019 shareholder proposal. He wasn\u2019t happy with it. We had to agree to disagree on whether insuring new fossil fuel projects was the right thing to do. Spoiler alert \u2013 I didn\u2019t think it was. I still don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>A call from a CEO is a rare occurrence, and it signaled to me that Green Century Funds\u2019 advocacy efforts were hitting their mark. However, I give a lot of credit to Travelers\u2019 CEO for taking the time to call and listen to my concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Being tenacious, and professionally polite, can pay big dividends. Further, the effort to meet board members helped humanize the relationship between Green Century Funds and Travelers. I\u2019ll meet with Travelers again later this year, but now we have a stronger rapport.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a privilege to be a shareholder advocate working on the toughest environmental challenges the world faces. Encounters with CEOs can result in better connections with corporate management. We always look for ways to collaborate, so we welcome phone calls from CEOs.
