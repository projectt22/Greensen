With that step, you don\u2019t invest in industries that you don\u2019t want to support. For example, if you are concerned about climate change, you don\u2019t have to invest your money in the stocks of oil and gas companies. Or if you care about tobacco addiction or\u00a0 factory farms and animal welfare, you can avoid the companies that make these products or are leaders in these industries. All the Green Century Funds have exclusionary screens to avoid environmentally dangerous companies. The Green Century Balanced Fund also invests in green and sustainable bonds that fund clean energy projects.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">What is the Impact of Sustainable Investing<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sustainable investing helps you align your investments with your values, but does it really help the environment or society? Green Century believes that sustainable investing does make an impact when large groups of people decide to avoid certain industries. This\u00a0 was the case in battling apartheid in South Africa when individuals and institutions moved their investments out of companies that were doing business in the country.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In the last 10 years, the fossil fuel divestment movement has helped shape the sustainable investing field and inspired individuals to divest from fossil fuels and influence their institutions \u2013 from Harvard University to the New York Pension Fund \u2013 to move their money. So far, nearly 1,500 organizations with assets of more than $39.2 trillion have committed to divest from fossil fuels.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This sustainable investing movement has helped the environment by getting investors to question the long-term viability of the fossil fuel industry once they understand the industry\u2019s plans. The concomitant media attention also helped raise awareness for investors and the public.\u00a0<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Invest Sustainably with Green Century Funds<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Green Century Funds have been helping people invest sustainably since 1991.
