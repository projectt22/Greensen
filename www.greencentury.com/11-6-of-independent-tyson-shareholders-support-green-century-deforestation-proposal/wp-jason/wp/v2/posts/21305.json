Susan Eggman (D-Stockton), <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Senate Bill 244<\/a> would make it easier and cheaper to get consumer electronics and appliances fixed. Under the bill, manufacturers like Apple must provide consumers or independent repair shops with sufficient documentation, tools, and parts. This bill would also reduce the e-waste currently filling landfills as consumers would be able to repair instead of discarding or upgrading their devices.<\/p>\n<p>Apple, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/research\/largest-companies-by-market-cap\/#:~:text=of%20August%202023.-,Key%20findings,and%20Amazon%20(%241.32%20trillion).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the largest company in the world<\/a>, had previously opposed allowing users to repair its products, until Green Century and others began negotiations with the company. Green Century\u2019s engagement<a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/thought-leadership\/\"> helped secure an agreement with Apple in 2021<\/a> that stated, for the first time, that Apple would provide consumers access to replacement parts, tools and repair manuals needed to perform common repairs to its products.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited that Apple has announced its support for this important legislation and recognize this is a major step forward for the company,\u201d said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate with Green Century Capital Management. \u201cBy supporting this legislation, Apple is sending a strong message that repairing, not replacing products, is good for consumers, good for the environment, and good for investors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>California Legislation Part of National Momentum<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Apple indicated its support for offering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely, while ensuring they wouldn\u2019t risk privacy or data issues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cApple supports California\u2019s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even greater access to repairs while also protecting their safety, security, and privacy,\u201d the company says <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/08\/23\/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a statement provided to TechCrunch.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The bill specifies that the duration of a manufacturer\u2019s obligation would depend on the product\u2019s cost. Those with a wholesale price of at least $50 would have a shorter time than products that cost more than $100, where the bill specifies that access to documentation tools and parts must be available for seven years.<\/p>\n<p>The California State Assembly has been debating the bill and a vote is expected shortly in the Assembly Appropriations Committee. The bill cleared the state Senate in May by a 38-0 vote.<\/p>\n<p>California has been a leader in the Right to Repair movement, with momentum increasing nationally as lawmakers from about 14 states have introduced similar bills. <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/articles\/right-to-repair-in-2022-what-happened-in-new-york-and-our-top-accomplishments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/updates\/colorado-tractor-right-to-repair-signed-into-law\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Colorado <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/articles\/minnesota-passes-broadest-right-to-repair-measure-to-date\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minnesota<\/a> all passed their own Right to Repair laws in the past year.<\/p>\n<p>A coalition <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/california\/updates\/82-repair-shops-sign-letter-in-support-of-right-to-repair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">of 82 repair shops have rallied behind the bill, which was backed by CalPIRG<\/a>, one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Ownership-2-pager-6.30.23.pdf\">nonprofit owners<\/a> of Green Century.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/edfund\/resources\/repair-saves-families-big\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to research by PIRG<\/a>, the average American family generates about 115 pounds of electronic waste each year, and nationally, the United States generates 6.9 million tons of electronic waste.<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
