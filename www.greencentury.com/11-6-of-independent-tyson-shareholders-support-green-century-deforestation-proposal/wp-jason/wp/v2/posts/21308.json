It is estimated the changes in policy could impact up to 120 million computers currently on the market.<\/p>\n<p>The multiple year extension by the parent company of Google* allows schools and families to keep functioning Chromebooks to remain in use, preventing those items from becoming e-waste.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a major win for the environment, schools, and the shareholder advocacy process,\u201d said Douglass Guernsey, a Shareholder Advocate at Green Century Capital Management. \u201cBy extending the life of Chromebooks commonly used in schools, Alphabet is getting ahead of addressing potential risks and making sure hardware using its software can be used for as long as possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Green Century and Consumer Activists Help Consumers and School Districts<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Green Century discuss risks raised by the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/PIRG-Chromebook-Churn-Full-Report-May-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chromebook Churn<\/a>\u201d published by <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/resources\/what-is-right-to-repair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PIRG<\/a> (Public Interest Research Groups) directly with Alphabet management in Summer 2023.
