A class-action lawsuit filed against Deere by farmers alleges that the company violated antitrust laws by restricting repair to dealerships, which increased company profits while hurting farmers.<\/p>\n<p>Shareholders Concerned That Deere Is Not Doing Enough to Support Right to Repair<\/p>\n<p>Recent polls indicate that an overwhelming 84% of Americans support Right to Repair legislation. In April 2023, Colorado became the first state to enact Right to Repair laws specifically targeting farm equipment. To date, 30 additional states have introduced Right to Repair bills, highlighting the growing momentum behind the issue.<\/p>\n<p>While Deere recently signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d (MOU) with The American Farm Bureau Federation which would allow farmers to buy access to repair information, the agreement has come under scrutiny. According to the MOU, the Farm Bureau would be restricted from advocating for enforceable legislation, and Deere would be allowed to pull out of the agreement if any legislation is passed.<\/p>\n<h3>Deere Opposed Right to Repair on Flimsy Grounds<\/h3>\n<p>There are also concerns that in its rush to oppose Right to Repair legislation, Deere may have made misleading statements in federal filings regarding the environmental consequences of repair.<\/p>\n<p>Deere claimed that existing EPA regulations and the Clean Air Act were some of the reasons that it would not give independent repair shops access to its diagnostic tools. In August 2023, however, the EPA issued a statement that it had no policy on restricting owners\u2019 repairs of emissions-related components of their products to properly function.<\/p>\n<p>Green Century previously filed a shareholder proposal with Deere on the same issue in 2021. Shareholders were unable to vote on the measure as Deere petitioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to exclude the proposal from the ballot. At the time, Green Century\u00b0 President Leslie Samuelrich said, \u201cDeere seems to be more focused on stifling shareholder concerns than addressing them. Spending time and energy on an SEC challenge could be put to better use by making their products better serve their customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-14508 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>About Green Century Funds<\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
