Nearly 400 million tons of plastics are produced annually, primarily from fossil fuels, creating a carbon footprint of approximately 1.8 billion tons of emissions each year. Plastic is also known to have negative impacts on environmental and human health at every stage of its lifecycle.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_18554\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18554\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-18554\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Plastic-GHG-Emissions-Graphic-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-18554\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, EPA)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h4>The estimated annual greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production worldwide is more than the emissions from 400 million cars, or greater than of all the cars in North America combined.<\/h4>\n<p>The letter from the Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development to the High Ambition Coalition, signed by Green Century and nearly 30 other institutional investors, urges countries to create a comprehensive, binding agreement to address global plastic design, production, and disposal. It also calls for investments in refillable bottle systems to replace single use plastics.<\/p>\n<p>The second letter, CDP\u2019s Open Letter to Governments, endorsed by 48 financial institutions with over $3.5 trillion AUM, calls for mandatory plastic data disclosure by all plastic producers globally.<\/p>\n<p>Progress has been made in recent years on plastic disclosure, yet many investors, corporations, and governments are still largely unaware of the types and quantities of plastics being produced. Requirements for better transparency are complicated by the more than 13,000 commonly used plastic additives which impact human health and decrease recyclability.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_18557\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-18557\" style=\"width: 480px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-18557 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Graph-Chemicals-Plastic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"236\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-18557\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Health Impact of Chemical Additives to Plastic Are Largely Unknown and Unregulated<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<h4><strong>Of the over 13,000 chemical additives to plastic, over 70% have adverse impacts on human health or have not yet been the subject of scientific studies. <\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>\u201cThe more you learn about plastics, the clearer the risks become,\u201d <strong>said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century.<\/strong> \u201cPlastic additives increase health and litigation risk for businesses and make plastic harder to recycle.
