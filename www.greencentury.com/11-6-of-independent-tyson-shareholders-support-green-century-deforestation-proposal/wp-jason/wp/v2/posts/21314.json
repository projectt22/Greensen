Headquartered in Atlanta, Home Depot is a major carrier of titanium dioxide-based paint. Green Century was joined in the filing by the Felician Sisters of North America, a national order of catholic sisters that seek to leverage societal change through shareholder advocacy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHome Depot acknowledges that sustainability efforts make its business stronger, more agile, and more resilient,\u201d said Green Century President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cA permanent commitment to protect the Okefenokee would do just that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At 438,000 acres, the Okefenokee Swamp is one of the world\u2019s largest intact freshwater <a href=\"https:\/\/onehundredmiles.org\/okefenokee\/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wetlands<\/a>. More than 402,000 acres are protected in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the largest refuge in the eastern United States and home to hundreds of plant and animal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuge\/okefenokee\/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">species<\/a>. The Okefenokee also stores over 400M tons of CO2 equivalent, making it one of the largest natural carbon sinks in North America.<\/p>\n<p>Twin Pines Minerals, LLC has <a href=\"https:\/\/onehundredmiles.org\/okefenokee\/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">applied for permits<\/a> to mine titanium on Trail Ridge, the swamp\u2019s eastern hydrologic boundary. Scientific consensus indicates that Twin Pines\u2019 project would <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wabe.org\/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">significantly damage the Okefenokee<\/a> by drawing down its water level and increasing risk of drought and landscape-level <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2023\/apr\/01\/georgia-okefenokee-swamp-twin-pines-mining\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fires<\/a>. Such events could destroy swamp wildlife habitat, damage thousands of acres of adjacent private timberland and release significant carbon emissions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPope Francis, in his encyclical, On Care For Our Common Home, states: \u2018The earth\u2019s resources are also being plundered because of short-sighted approaches to the economy, commerce and production,\u2019\u201d said Sister Jean Sliwinski, sustainability coordinator with Felician Sisters of North America. \u201cMining along the edge of this resource puts too much at risk with the potential for irreversible damage to this fragile ecosystem.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>These concerns have fueled heightened public attention and controversy. Over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wabe.org\/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100,000 comments<\/a> were submitted to Georgia\u2019s Environmental Protection Division opposing TPM\u2019s draft Mining Land Use Plan in early 2023, and polling indicates that <a href=\"https:\/\/thebrunswicknews.com\/news\/local_news\/clear-majority-of-georgians-oppose-mine\/article_7bba11f8-2b7e-5368-9a9a-952d4cdd4451.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nearly 70%<\/a> of Georgians want Governor Kemp to deny TPM\u2019s permits. Furthermore, Okefenokee is <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/okefenokee-wildlife-refuge-unesco-world-heritage-site-499cd975a576658966f7abef26dbba1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">being nominated<\/a> for inclusion on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Site List, and the issue has received significant media coverage.<\/p>\n<p>While Home Depot has confirmed that its primary paint suppliers do not currently have plans to source TiO2 from the proposed Twin Pines mine, it has not made a public commitment regarding future titanium sourcing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMining has no place near an ecological gem like the Okefenokee,\u201d said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy with Green Century. \u201cWith headquarters in the Okefenokee\u2019s backyard, Home Depot has a unique opportunity to bolster its environmental image with customers, employees and shareholders, many of whom care deeply about the swamp\u2019s future, all while protecting the company from serious financial and systemic risks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>About Green Century Funds<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
