Here are some highlights.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong> Renewable energy plans for top chipmakers<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-18785 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Silicon chips are found everywhere these days &#8212; in computers, cell phones, cars, and other consumer and industrial products. Green Century helped convince five top chipmakers to map out their paths to cut carbon emissions. This industry-wide win included some familiar names &#8212; Intel Corporation*, Texas Instruments*, as well as NVIDIA*, Advanced Micro Devices* and ON Semiconductor*. We\u2019re pleased these companies agreed to specify the actions and milestones they will take to reduce carbon and source more renewable energy for the health of our planet.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong> Convincing insurers to move away from fossil fuels<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-18786 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture2-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this year brought more frequent hurricanes, tornadoes, and intense storms due to climate change. Consequently, several insurance companies have stopped issuing new policies for homeowners in California and Florida because of mounting claims. We think it makes sense for them to stop offering insurance coverage to the very industry that has driven these problems. That\u2019s why Green Century led the second year of our campaign to get insurers to stop underwriting and supporting new oil and gas projects. This year, Chubb*, one of the world\u2019s largest insurance companies, agreed to announce it would immediately stop insuring oil and gas projects in conservation areas. This means that worldwide nature reserves, wilderness areas, and marine protected areas will be better safeguarded.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong> Deforestation rates hit decades-low in Indonesia<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Did you know that for decades tropical forests were destroyed for the cultivation of palm oil, which is found in products ranging from crackers, cookies, and cosmetics, and that Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest producer of palm oil? Burning those forests eliminates habitats for orangutans, Sumatran Elephants and other wildlife while releasing tons of carbon pollution into the air.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s heartening that deforestation rates have declined steadily each year in Indonesia for the last 10 years. And in 2021, it hit a 22-year low!<\/p>\n<p>For the last 10 years, Green Century has pressed companies to switch to producing, trading, buying, and changing how palm oil is grown in Indonesia to protect the environment and this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/kraft-heinz-sets-global-policy-to-eliminate-deforestation-in-response-to-green-century-shareholder-proposal\/\">Green Century convinced Kraft Heinz*<\/a>, one of the largest food and beverage companies, to adopt the most comprehensive global forest protection policy we have ever seen from a food company.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> Met people eager to invest with their values throughout the country <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Green Century traveled to events in every region of the country from Los Angeles to New York City, and wherever we went, we found individuals and financial advisors eager to invest in environmentally responsible ways. From the <em>Land Rally<\/em> in Oregon to<em> ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) for Impact! <\/em>in Colorado, we look forward to building on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/events\/\">connections and conversations<\/a> we experienced.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Addressing the plastic pollution crisis<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-18787\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Picture3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Given the global and growing crisis of plastic pollution, Green Century has redoubled its efforts to encourage companies to recycle, reuse and reduce use of plastics. This year, we engaged companies one-by-one and joined forces with major investors in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.breakfreefromplastic.org\/plastics-treaty\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UN Global Plastics Treaty<\/a>, an ambitious global effort to end the age of plastic by 2024 in a legally binding document.<\/p>\n<p>Our latest win involves Costco Wholesale*, one of the largest retailers in the world. Our shareholder advocates convinced Costco to expand its plastics reduction efforts. The company committed to increased plastic footprint disclosures and creating a 5-year plastic action plan. This victory, along with the policies we have secured from 12 other companies including Keurig Dr Pepper*, will help keep plastic out of our oceans and protect wildlife<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--base); color: var(--wp--preset--color--contrast); font-family: var(--wp--preset--font-family--system-font); font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--medium);\">5.

Together with many allies, they also secured new protections for the Boundary Waters (Minnesota), Bristol Bay (Alaska), Chaco Canyon (New Mexico) and the Grand Canyon region (Arizona). In November, voters approved an Environment Texas-backed $1 billion bond <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/articles\/texans-vote-yes-on-1-billion-for-state-parks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to fund the largest expansion of parks in the state history<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: var(--wp--preset--color--base); color: var(--wp--preset--color--contrast); font-family: var(--wp--preset--font-family--system-font); font-size: var(--wp--preset--font-size--medium);\">4. Won Right to Repair victories for Chromebook users and farmers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Green Century and nonprofit owner, Colorado Public Interest Research Group (CoPIRG) worked together on an effort that led to the Centennial State becoming the first in the nation ensuring farmers can fix their tractors and other equipment.<\/p>\n<p>This victory builds on our earlier engagements with Deere &amp; Company*, the manufacturer of the iconic\u00a0John Deere tractor and a wide array of other agriculture equipment, to reverse its opposition to the right-to-repair movement. Additionally, Green Century and CoPIRG together called on Google* to extend<a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/colorado\/articles\/when-will-my-chromebook-expire-why-computers-should-be-designed-to-last\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> software on Chromebooks used by school districts and students across the nation<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/googles-chromebook-extension-is-a-win-in-the-fight-against-e-waste\/\">Green Century engagement<\/a> led to the company announcing plans to continue software updates for Chromebooks for up to 10 years starting in 2024. This win means millions of serviceable laptops continued to be used instead of ending up in landfills.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Led the Fossil Fuel Free Movement<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-18796 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/FFF-front-page-image-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/>Green Century became one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds in 2014 and this April we updated our popular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/fossil-fuel-free-investing-guide-sign-up\/\">Fossil Fuel Free Investing Guide,<\/a> co-authored this year with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenamerica.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Green America.<\/a>\u00a0 Get your free copy and listen to our webinar <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PA_JM7-KayU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Greening Your Investments<\/em><\/a> if you or your family members are interested in joining thousands of individuals and institutions, including Harvard University and the Church of England, avoid the coal, oil and gas industry in your investments.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe must stop climate change.
