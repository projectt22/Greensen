Green Century\u00b0, one of the first families of fossil fuel free mutual funds in the U.S., filed three shareholder resolutions asking toy companies Disney*, Hasbro* and Mattel* to cut single-use plastic. Not only is excessive plastic packaging unnecessary and wasteful, but toy companies could also increase long-term value by reducing risks from single-use plastics used to package toys.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome toys have more plastic packaging than actual toy \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense fiscally or environmentally,\u201d <strong>said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cThere are real business concerns from single-use plastic, ranging from damaged brand reputation from plastic pollution to legal action because of toxicity. A toy&#8217;s packaging shouldn&#8217;t outlive the people who play with it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h5>It is estimated that American\u2019s household waste increases by more than 25% from Thanksgiving to New Years. Much of this waste comes from plastic packaging.<\/h5>\n<p>Excessive plastic packaging is highly visible and unpopular, and governments have increasingly issued taxes and bans on single-use plastic. Companies also face legal risk, as exemplified by New York state suing PepsiCo over river pollution and the multibillion-dollar fines leveled at manufacturers of plastic additive PFAS, commonly known as forever chemicals.<\/p>\n<p>PFAS is one of the many chemicals manufacturers use in plastic packaging. This and other plastic additives, which are often largely unknown even to companies, are a particular concern for the toy industry as children are more susceptible to the effects of environmental toxins.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlastic is hurting wildlife in our oceans, and it&#8217;s also hurting us,\u201d said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century<\/strong>. \u201cOf the over 13,000 chemicals associated with plastics and plastic production, most have not been studied or are harmful to humans. Companies need to fully disclose their plastic footprints and commit to reducing all non-essential, single-use plastic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While investors are examining the growing issue, representatives from the UN are debating a global plastics treaty that could make companies responsible for the waste they create. Experts have stated that the best way to address the growing plastic crisis is to first reduce plastic use and production, particularly for non-essential single-use plastics, which are defined as plastics that are not absolutely necessary, have available alternatives, and have an intended lifespan of one use or less than 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-14508 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>About Green Century Funds<\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
