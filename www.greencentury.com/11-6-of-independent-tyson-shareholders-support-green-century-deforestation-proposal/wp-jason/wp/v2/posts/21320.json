The <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/articles\/the-epa-finally-refutes-john-deere-dealership-arguments-against-right-to-repair\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EPA<\/a> has rejected these concerns, and advocates point out that if farmers are limited in their repair options, they face increased costs and may miss critical harvesting deadlines.<\/p>\n<p>Last November, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/legal\/litigation\/deere-must-face-us-farmers-right-to-repair-lawsuits-judge-rules-2023-11-27\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. District Judge<\/a> in Illinois stated that Deere must face claims that it had conspired to restrict repairs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGreen Century will continue to advocate for the right to repair,\u201d said Douglass Guernsey, a shareholder advocate working on the issue. \u201cAccess to repair not only benefits consumers and the economy, but it is a critical environmental issue.
