The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/statement-majority-of-home-depot-shareholders-support-deforestation-shareholder-proposal-filed-by-green-century\/\">proposal<\/a>, which received <a href=\"https:\/\/www.governance-intelligence.com\/shareholders-activism\/home-depot-shareholders-back-deforestation-and-racial-equity-proposals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">64% of the shareholder vote<\/a> in May 2022, asked the company to assess how it could increase the scale, pace and rigor of its efforts to eliminate deforestation and forest degradation from its supply chains.<\/p>\n<p>The report covers an in-depth assessment of the company\u2019s wood sourcing policies and announces a set of strengthened standards that will protect high-risk regions such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldwildlife.org\/places\/cerrado\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cerrado<\/a> in Brazil, the world&#8217;s most biodiverse savanna and home to 5% of the planet&#8217;s animals and plants. The report also asserts that the wood Home Depot sources from Canada is sustainable, sidestepping concerns that the company\u2019s sourcing policies from the region contribute to degradation of the Canadian boreal forest.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe applaud Home Depot\u2019s new commitments that will protect more tropical ecosystems and the rich biodiversity our planet needs to thrive,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/leslie-samuelrich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, President of Green Century Funds. \u201cHowever, we believe the company\u2019s Canadian sourcing policies fall short of the standards needed to protect the boreal forest, home to critical wildlife habitat for species such as grizzly bears and caribou.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the report, Home Depot announced an expansion of its approach to sustainable sourcing such that by the end of fiscal year 2026, wood products sourced to the U.S. and Canada from an additional set of high-risk regions will be required to bear third-party certification or be plantation-grown. The new policy covers a majority of Home Depot\u2019s overall wood sourcing and includes regions such as the Cerrado, Gran Chaco, and Atlantic Forest biomes in South America.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHome Depot\u2019s new sustainable wood sourcing policies are a welcome step in the right direction,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/annie-sanders\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Annie Sanders<\/a>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. \u201cWe congratulate the company for establishing new protections in tropical ecosystems and urge additional steps to more fully protect primary forests in the Canadian boreal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The North American boreal forest is the largest intact ecosystem left on the planet. Disturbances from logging in the boreal forest have endangered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/business\/technology\/science\/article-across-canada-caribou-are-on-the-edge-of-extinction-a-prominent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than half<\/a> of the iconic woodland caribou herds. Unfortunately, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/01\/04\/world\/canada\/canada-boreal-forest-logging.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new study<\/a> shows that logging in Canada\u2019s boreal forest is causing severe damage, harming wildlife and compromising the forest\u2019s ability to absorb and store carbon, which is critical for fighting climate change.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-14508\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/contact-us-button-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
