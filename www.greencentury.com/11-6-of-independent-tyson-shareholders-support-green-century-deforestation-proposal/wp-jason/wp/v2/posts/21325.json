Independent shareholders include all shares that are not held by Tyson Limited Partnership or Tyson\u2019s directors or executive officers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIndependent shareholders have sent a strong message that Tyson can\u2019t put deforestation on the back burner,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. \u201cTyson should step up to the plate and make sure its meat doesn\u2019t come with a side of forest destruction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The pace of deforestation broke records in 2023 in the Brazilian Cerrado, the world&#8217;s most biologically rich savanna, surging by nearly 45% since 2022. To produce its extensive line of meat products, Tyson Foods buys ingredients from countries around the world, including from high-risk regions such as Brazil where cattle ranching is the largest driver of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.org\/content\/dam\/tnc\/nature\/en\/documents\/brasil\/tnc-execs-environmentalframeworkcattle.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deforestation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Tyson\u2019s Deforestation Goals Fall Short<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Tyson aims to achieve a deforestation-free beef supply chain by the end of 2028 and to eliminate deforestation in its soy and palm oil supply chains by 2030. These goals fall 3-5 years short of recommendations from standard-setting bodies that have concluded that companies can\u2019t hit their climate targets without eliminating deforestation by <a href=\"https:\/\/sciencebasedtargets.org\/sectors\/forest-land-and-agriculture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2025<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Tyson also lags peers including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/release-hormel-foods-commits-to-no-deforestation-by-2025\/\">Hormel Foods<\/a>* and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/processed-food-giant-conagra-to-eliminate-deforestation-from-its-supply-chains\/\">Conagra<\/a>*, both of which recently pledged to be deforestation-free by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis vote demonstrates a growing understanding among investors that deforestation in Tyson\u2019s supply chain exposes the company to material risks,\u201d said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. \u201cWe urge the company to take investor concern seriously and accelerate progress toward zero-deforestation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Tyson family\u2019s control of Class B shares means it holds up to 70% of the voting rights at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pionline.com\/governance\/new-york-state-common-challenges-tysons-dual-share-stock-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">company<\/a>.
