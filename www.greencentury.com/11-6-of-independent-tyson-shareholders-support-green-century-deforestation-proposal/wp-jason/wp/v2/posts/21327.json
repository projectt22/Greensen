According to a recent survey, 80% of U.S. respondents from across the political spectrum support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDelighting guests and reducing single-use plastics are clearly compatible,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/meet-our-team\/\">Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century<\/a>. \u201cCustomers want hospitality that doesn\u2019t compromise the beauty of the places they might have traveled thousands of miles to visit.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4>It is estimated that two garbage trucks worth of plastic enter the ocean every minute.<\/h4>\n<p>Recycling, long touted as the solution to the plastic waste crisis, has resulted in only 9% of plastic being recycled. Scientists and experts agree that the best way to reduce plastic pollution is to cut the amount of plastic companies are producing, and to replace non-essential single-use plastic with tested alternatives like reuseable containers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cChoice is taking the first steps in addressing plastic pollution by better understanding how and how much plastic is used for its hotels,\u201d added Guernsey. \u201cThe next step is to implement reductions, which will return long term value to consumers, the business, and investors.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/impact\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17909 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
