Plastic production has grown explosively in the past 60 years, with estimates predicting we will produce nearly 1480 million tons of plastic by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>Of this, only 9% is likely to be recycled. In fact, plastic is more likely to be burned than recycled, with disastrous consequences for children living near incineration facilities. All other plastic results in waste that doesn\u2019t degrade but breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics which pollute our oceans, soil, atmosphere and even our bloodstream.<\/p>\n<p>Green Century has been engaging companies about their plastic use and waste for three years and has secured more than a dozen agreements with companies including Disney,* Costco,* and Mattel*.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUltimately, disclosure is about accountability and empowering consumers, managers and investors to make better decisions,\u201d said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate<\/strong> with Green Century. \u201cBy improving transparency of its plastic use, Hasbro is positioning itself to be a more sustainable company.\u201d<a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17909 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
