The bigger bottles are more recyclable and help reduce plastic waste.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGiven Marriott\u2019s scale, with more than 1.5 million hotel rooms worldwide, small changes make massive impacts,\u201d said Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate with Green Century. \u201cWe are pleased that the company is working to create a more sustainable business and planet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plastic Pollution Continues its Explosive Growth<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Plastic pollution entering the oceans has been doubling every six years, killing 1 million marine creatures annually. More than 91% of plastics are not recycled.<\/p>\n<p>Experts agree that reducing non-essential single-use plastic is necessary to address the growing plastic pollution crisis.<\/p>\n<p>While some plastic doesn\u2019t have viable alternatives, many single-use applications do.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCompanies first need to understand the scale of the problem and disclose the risks associated with it,\u201d said Guernsey. \u201cOnly with reliable information can investors make cogent decisions to reduce the tidal wave of plastic pollution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17909\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
