This action was prompted by reports from the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) indicating that the end of support for Windows 10 could lead to the <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/media-center\/20000-call-on-microsoft-to-save-400-million-pcs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest jump in junked computers ever<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis allows schools to extend the life of the products they buy, which keeps them out of landfills and incinerators where they release harmful toxins,\u201d said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong>, President of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\">Green Century Funds<\/a>. \u201cIt is an important step, and we hope that this discount pricing will be extended beyond schools to everyone to protect our communities and our environment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An estimated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/2022\/10\/10\/windows_11_adoption\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">330-400 million devices<\/a> currently running on Windows 10 may not be eligible for upgrade because of hardware requirements and will lose essential security updates after October 14, 2025. In October 2023, PIRG delivered <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/news\/petition-calls-on-microsoft-to-extend-windows-10-support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20,000 petition signatures<\/a> to the company calling for Microsoft to extend support.<\/p>\n<p>Pricing for schools will be $1 per computer the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year. Base license cost for businesses will be between $45 and $61 per year, with the price doubling each consecutive year. The company plans to offer special pricing for nonprofits and individuals.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Longer Lasting Computers Good for the Environment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Extending the lifespan of computers is a big win for the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the environmental impact of computers and other electronics comes not from electricity use, but the carbon and materials needed to produce the equipment. Extending the life of consumer electronics is the best way to cut down on the environmental footprint of the industry.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGetting an extra three years of computer life for $7 is a no brainer for the environment,\u201d said <strong>Douglass Guernsey<\/strong>, shareholder advocate. \u201cWe encourage the company to offer this deal beyond the classroom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17909\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
