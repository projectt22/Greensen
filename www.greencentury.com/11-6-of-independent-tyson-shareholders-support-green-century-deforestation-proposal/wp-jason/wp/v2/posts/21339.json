Mattel fulfilled that agreement in 2022 by committing to reduce its plastic packaging by 25% per product by 2030.<\/p>\n<p>This additional commitment to disclose information on single-use plastic in packaging to CDP will help stakeholders better understand Mattel\u2019s sustainable packaging efforts through a recognized, standardized reporting platform.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Mattel to join 3,000 global companies reporting to CDP Plastic<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Standardized reporting is an essential first step in reducing plastic pollution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRight now, each company discloses plastic information in different ways, making it nearly impossible for governments, recyclers, and investors to really know what plastic is out there,\u201d said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate at Green Century<\/strong>. \u201cWe really view CDP as the gold standard when it comes to voluntary disclosure.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Plastic pollution continues explosive growth<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The current plastic waste system has failed to keep plastic out of the ecosystem. Only <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/edfund\/campaigns\/beyond-plastic\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">9% of plastic waste is recycled<\/a>, while plastic pollution has doubled every six years.<\/p>\n<p>Plastic waste makes its way into waterways, killing marine life and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, as plastic doesn\u2019t break down like other materials, small particles of \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/edfund\/updates\/microplastics-in-100-of-the-co-waterways-we-tested\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">microplastics<\/a>\u201d have been found in every environment and even the human bloodstream.<\/p>\n<p>The issue has increasingly alarmed consumers and investors.
