ADM\u2019s new policy will eliminate primary native vegetation conversion, or the repurposing of wild land for crops such as soy and corn, from its global supply chains by 2025 for direct suppliers and by 2027 for indirect suppliers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCritical ecosystems like the Cerrado, Gran Chaco and Pantanal may be less well-known than the Amazon, but they\u2019re just as important when it comes to protecting our planet from biodiversity loss and climate change,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/leslie-samuelrich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, president of Green Century Funds\u00b0. \u201cWe congratulate ADM on enhancing protections for these special places.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Shareholder Proposal Prompted Study, Protections <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In response to a shareholder proposal filed by Green Century, Robeco and BNP Paribas Asset Management, ADM had agreed in spring 2023 to conduct a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/adm-moves-to-strengthen-no-deforestation-policy\/\">feasibility study<\/a> to eliminate native vegetation conversion from its South American soy and corn supply chains and issue a correlated commitment. The feasibility study completed in November 2023 and published in April 2024 informed ADM\u2019s new \u201cno-conversion\u201d commitment, which covers supply chains in the Brazilian Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, as well as the Paraguayan and Argentinian Chaco.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe ADM has made significant progress in ensuring business continuity in an increasingly fragile ecosystem by having a clear outlook on key areas needing protection across its supply chain,\u201d said Peter van der Werf, Head of Engagement at Robeco. \u201cImportantly, the assessment allows ADM to prioritize already degraded land fit for further agricultural expansion, allowing it to steer investments and help farmers to move forward in a sustainable manner.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Native vegetation conversion <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalforestwatch.org\/blog\/commodities\/soy-production-forests-south-america\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">degrades ecosystems such as the Cerrado<\/a> savanna in Brazil that are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Soy production is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalforestwatch.org\/blog\/commodities\/soy-production-forests-south-america\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leading cause of native vegetation conversion<\/a> in South American habitats and contributes to a broader decline of South American wilderness.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"attachment-266x266 size-266x266\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1.png 681w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"266\" height=\"78\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
