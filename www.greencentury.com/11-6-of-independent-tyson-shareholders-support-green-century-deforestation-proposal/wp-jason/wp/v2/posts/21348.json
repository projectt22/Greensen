M. Smucker Co* announced that its Hostess brand, which includes iconic snack products like Twinkies, Snowballs and CupCakes, will be switching completely to direct purchases of cage-free eggs by 2028. J. M. Smucker achieved a 100% cage-free egg supply before acquiring the Hostess brand in 2023. Hostess previously did not use cage-free eggs.<\/p>\n<p>J. M. Smucker Co made the commitment after signing an agreement with Green Century.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBringing cage-free eggs to an iconic American brand like Hostess means happier hens and healthier snacks,\u201d said <strong>Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cWe admire Smucker\u2019s commitment, proving that big brands play a key role in building a more ethical food industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Smucker\u2019s provided a glidepath towards reaching its cage-free egg goal and will transparently report on its progress annually in its sustainability report.<\/p>\n<h3>Green Century\u2019s advocacy promotes animal welfare<\/h3>\n<p>Green Century has taken a leading role in promoting animal welfare at major brands advocating for healthy and humane conditions for animals. Carl Icahn nominated Samuelrich in 2022 for the board of McDonald\u2019s after the company backed away from its gestation crate-free pork pledge. Green Century also recently filed a shareholder resolution at Darden, parent company of Olive Garden, asking the company to commit to removing gestation crates from its supply chain.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGrowing visibility into supply chains means that animal welfare can no longer be \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019,\u201d said <strong>Douglass Guernsey, shareholder advocate<\/strong>. \u201cConsumers will continue to learn about &#8211; and demand &#8211; better treatment for animals in agriculture.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
