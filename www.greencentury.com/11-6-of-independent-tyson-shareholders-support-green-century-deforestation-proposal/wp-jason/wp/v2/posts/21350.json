We hope they hear this clear message from shareholders: the company should account for its reliance on nature, it should disclose its impacts, and it should reduce those impacts wherever possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Strong support leading into the meeting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ahead of the vote, several large investment groups voiced their support for the proposal, including Norges Bank Investment Management, Allianz Global Investors, and Storebrand Asset Management. The proposal reflects an increased understanding by investors that biodiversity and nature must be considered when evaluating company performance.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe used to take nature for granted, but we don\u2019t have that luxury anymore,\u201d said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. \u201cCompanies have to ensure their operations have a positive impact on nature. Investors need comprehensive biodiversity reporting through accepted frameworks to have confidence in a company\u2019s behavior.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday\u2019s vote was the first time a proposal requesting a comprehensive biodiversity report has been voted on by shareholders of a publicly traded company. Shareholder votes are advisory, and a vote at this level will help ensure the issue stays on the company agenda.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">###<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-17909\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
