Because of that, its overall emissions reduction may be as little as 7% by 2030 or, worse, even increase.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for Timken to move from a laggard to a leadership position on climate and the clean energy transition,\u201d said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cWe appreciate the investors who stood with us in asking the company to accelerate and expand its efforts to cut its carbon footprint ,and we invite more to keep the pressure on Timken.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Timken Flirting with Climate and Reputational Risk<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Timken, headquartered in Cleveland, manufactures tapered bearings made out of steel. Its products are used by many industries including food and beverage, marine vessels, mining, agriculture, construction, commercial vehicles, and renewable energy systems. As of 2023, the company employed more than 19,000 people in 45 countries.<\/p>\n<p>Timken has been recognized as one of <a href=\"https:\/\/news.timken.com\/2024-04-16-Timken-Recognized-by-Fortune-as-one-of-Americas-Most-Innovative-Companies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">America&#8217;s Most Responsible Companies<\/a> by Newsweek, the World&#8217;s Most Ethical Companies\u00ae by Ethisphere, America&#8217;s Most Innovative Companies by Fortune and America&#8217;s Best Large Employers by Forbes.<\/p>\n<p>Despite receiving multiple accolades, Timken is not fully addressing how its business contributes to climate change, which may hurt future profitability and make the company less attractive to investors. Companies with global operations and supply chains, like Timken, are <a href=\"https:\/\/e360.yale.edu\/features\/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vulnerable to a variety of climate impacts<\/a> ranging from droughts and floods to hurricanes. Therefore, we believe concerted efforts to achieve economy-wide emissions reductions are paramount.<\/p>\n<p>Timken is a supplier to the wind and solar industry, which comprised over 9% of its sales in 2023. Many companies across industry sectors are scrutinizing the sustainability of their supply chains, and renewable energy developers are sensitive about sourcing from suppliers that aren\u2019t reducing their carbon footprints. If Timken does not take steps to reduce its climate emissions, it may incur reputational damage as its clients and investors may call out its refusal to adopt meaningful emissions reduction targets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNearly <a href=\"https:\/\/sciencebasedtargets.org\/companies-taking-action\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">8,000 companies<\/a> have now set or committed to set emissions reduction targets through the Science Based Targets initiative, which supports the goals of the Paris agreement,\u201d commented Andrea Ranger, shareholder advocate at Green Century. \u201cBy holding back, Timken is creating risk for investors, especially when bold climate action is required.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-17909\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
