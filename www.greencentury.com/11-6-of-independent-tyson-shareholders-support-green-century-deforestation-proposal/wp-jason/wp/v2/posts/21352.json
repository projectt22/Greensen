The proposal asks Ford to disclose deforestation risk associated with the leather, rubber, and minerals it buys, and encourages the company to support efforts to expand supplies of green steel and aluminum.<\/p>\n<p>Ford purchases leather, rubber, and minerals for\u00a0 car seats, tires, and auto parts. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/11\/17\/climate\/leather-seats-cars-rainforest.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Raising cattle<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/e360.yale.edu\/features\/rubber-plantations-deforestation-tires-electric-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">harvesting rubber<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.tempo.co\/read\/1827220\/nickel-downstream-leads-to-uncontrollable-deforestation-in-north-maluku-environmental-groups-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mining minerals<\/a> are associated with deforestation and ecological damage. However, the company is silent on how these materials could lead to long-term environmental damage, especially in vulnerable areas like Brazil, Indonesia, West Africa, and Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Ford has committed to buying <a href=\"https:\/\/media.ford.com\/content\/fordmedia\/fna\/us\/en\/news\/2022\/11\/09\/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">green primary steel and aluminum for 10%<\/a> of its total purchase by 2030. Yet not one ton of green steel or aluminum is manufactured currently in the United States. The proposal asks Ford how it will attain its 2030 goal and to join NGO-led organizations like ResponsibleSteel and the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative (ASI), which support sustainable production of these metals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled that Ford is advancing quickly to manufacture climate friendly vehicles \u2013 like EVs,\u201d said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cBut the company faces material risk in its supply chain from the products it uses. Companies have to be relentless in investigating and changing their total impact on the environment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Competitors Exceed Ford On Green Steel and Aluminum <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Volvo and Mercedes-Benz participate in the steel plant sustainability standard, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.responsiblesteel.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ResponsibleSteel<\/a>, and Volvo has joined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theclimategroup.org\/about-steelzero-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SteelZero<\/a>, where members commit purchasing 100% green steel by 2050. Ford would be the first North American auto manufacturer to participate in these initiatives and could accelerate the wider availability of green metals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFord\u2019s Road to Better slogan describes its commitment to building a more sustainable\u00a0 transportation future,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cInstead of \u00a0fighting our proposal at the ballot box, we want Ford to remain on the Road to Better. We believe Ford should implement our proposal to protect nature and biodiversity and ensure it supports\u00a0 development of steel and aluminum manufacturing that is powered by renewable energy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-17909\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
