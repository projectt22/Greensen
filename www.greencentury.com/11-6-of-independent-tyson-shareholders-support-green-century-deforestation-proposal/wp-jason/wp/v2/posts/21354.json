The proposal also asked Ford to buy more sustainable steel and aluminum, and pushed for the company to purchase steel and aluminum plants that run off of clean, renewable energy.<\/p>\n<p>The Ford family has significant control over Ford business decisions because it owns a special class of stock that ensures it has \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/quartr.com\/insights\/business-philosophy\/the-ford-family-a-permanent-mark-in-business-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40% of the voting power<\/a>.

Currently, not a single ton of sustainable steel and aluminum is manufactured in the United States. Green Century\u2019s proposal asks Ford to join organizations like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.responsiblesteel.org\/who-we-are\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ResponsibleSteel<\/a> and the <a href=\"https:\/\/aluminium-stewardship.org\/drive-change\/sustainability-priorities\/climate-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aluminum Stewardship Initiative<\/a>, which \u00a0develop sustainability certifications for aluminum and steel manufacturers and push them to replace fossil fuels with renewables.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile we had wished for a higher vote, we\u2019re pleased with the support we received,\u201d said Green Century Funds President Leslie Samuelrich. \u201cEnhancing supply chain sustainably at Ford is a new initiative for us, and we plan to keep pressure on the company to address its material environmental risk.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sustainable Supply Chains Are Key<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2022, Ford set a target to purchase sustainable steel and aluminum for <a href=\"https:\/\/media.ford.com\/content\/fordmedia\/fna\/us\/en\/news\/2022\/11\/09\/ford--first-movers-coalition-announce-expansion-of-commitment-to.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10% of its total steel and aluminum purchases by 2030<\/a>. The company also planned to <a href=\"https:\/\/media.ford.com\/content\/fordmedia\/fna\/us\/en\/news\/2024\/04\/04\/ford-updates-timing-for-next-gen-evs--readies-manufacturing-plan.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">add EVs to its fleet<\/a>, which are manufactured with more aluminum than gas-powered cars to offset the extra battery weight. The Aluminum Stewardship Initiative works to ensure that aluminum producers are cutting emissions significantly by 2025. Similarly, ResponsibleSteel has a mission to \u201c&#8230;be a driving force in the socially and environmentally responsible production of net-zero steel, globally.\u201d Ford may benefit by joining both organizations, using its influence as a major consumer of steel and aluminum to press for greener production.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone wants to buy a Ford Explorer or F-150 and learn that the leather, rubber, and minerals in their vehicles contributed to deforestation,\u201d said Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cSustainability needs to be woven into every aspect of Ford\u2019s supply chain, because Green Century believe it\u2019s good for Ford\u2019s investors, customers, and the company itself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/greencentury.com\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-17909\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"88\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
