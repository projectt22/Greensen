The company insures companies that drill for oil and gas, operate oil pipelines, and build liquified natural gas terminals, including in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.citizen.org\/news\/risk-exposure-the-insurers-backing-the-lng-boom\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">communities on the Gulf Coast of the United States<\/a>.

In the company&#8217;s 2023 annual report, Chubb acknowledged that climate change-fueled severe weather and natural catastrophes may have challenged its profitability. Chubb also made headlines in late 2021, when it decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/wildfire-risk-in-california-drives-insurers-to-pull-policies-for-pricey-homes-11642593601\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pull homeowners insurance coverage<\/a> in wildfire prone areas of California.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Chubb ranks <a href=\"https:\/\/global.insure-our-future.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2023\/11\/IOF-2023-Scorecard.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4<sup>th<\/sup> on the Insure Our Future\u2019s 2022 list of top fossil fuel insurers in the world,<\/a> and is a <a href=\"https:\/\/global.insure-our-future.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2022\/02\/IOF-Brazil-report_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">key insurer of Brazil\u2019s national oil company<\/a>, which directs exploratory and ongoing drilling in some of the world\u2019s most sensitive ecological sites around the Great Amazon Reef and along Brazil\u2019s coastline.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs investors, we know there are short-term rewards for providing insurance to fossil fuel interests,\u201d commented Green Century Shareholder Advocate Andrea Ranger. \u201cHowever, the long-term consequences of short-term decisions is what we\u2019re concerned about.
