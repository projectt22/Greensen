Specifically, the proposal requested that General Motors issue an annual report providing additional disclosure on these sustainability risks within its supply chain, as well as on risk mitigation efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUltimately, we don\u2019t think GM wants to be associated with exacerbating global warming or destroying the rainforest,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, Green Century Funds President. \u201cIf the company truly wants to clean up its supply chain and ensure a timely transition to a sustainable future, it should invest now in clean, green, deforestation-free supply chains.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aluminum and steel sectors emit billions of tons of climate pollution annually and will require rapid decarbonization to avoid catastrophic global warming. Leather and rubber, both commonly used in vehicle manufacturing, are linked to tropical deforestation from Brazil to Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>General Motors\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gm.com\/commitments\/sustainability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goals<\/a> to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 and sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035 may depend in part on how it responds to concerns raised by Green Century\u2019s proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, General Motors has not established clear targets for procuring green steel or aluminum, nor has it joined industry associations such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.responsiblesteel.org\/who-we-are\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ResponsibleSteelTM<\/a> that are working to increase customer demand for green steel. The company may also be sourcing leather and rubber from regions associated with deforestation and currently lacks the disclosure, targets and metrics to indicate progress toward deforestation-free supply chains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs one of the largest auto companies in the world, GM has a leadership role to play in addressing climate and deforestation risk,\u201d said Annie Sanders, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century. \u201cMany European auto companies, such as BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Volvo, are already making commitments to source low-carbon metals and protect forests. GM has an opportunity to both catch up to these peers and lead the way for American manufacturers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/contact\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Learn-more-button-1-1-300x88.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17909\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
