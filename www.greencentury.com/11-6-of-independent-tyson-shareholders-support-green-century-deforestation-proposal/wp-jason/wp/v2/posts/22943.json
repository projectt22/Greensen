Before that, I had spent a couple of decades as a fundraiser and fundraising strategist for nonprofit organizations and political campaigns. The work was fulfilling and impactful, but I wanted to do even more to make a difference on environmental issues.&nbsp; Future generations deserve a healthy planet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined Green Century because I thought the firm\u2019s approach to shareholder advocacy was the best in the business and offered a path toward generating an immediate positive impact for the environment. We just released <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024-SA-Season-Highlights-6.30.24-1.pdf\">our impact report<\/a> on the last year in advocacy, and it\u2019s an impressive set of results that follows many years of similarly impressive results \u2013 and it\u2019s not just me who thinks so. Others have told us that Green Century \u201cpunches above its weight\u201d in holding corporations accountable for protecting the planet, and I\u2019m thankful to be part of this team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have learned so much in these five years, and so I thought I would share five observations:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sustainable investing is everywhere. I was hired by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a>, president of Green Century Funds, because she was looking for someone who could help expand our investor base beyond New England, New York, and the West Coast. I\u2019m located in Chicago, and I am responsible for the midwestern and southeastern states. I have spent a good amount of time building relationships with people in Chicago, Atlanta, and Minneapolis, but I have also traveled to places like Nashville, Indiana, and Decorah, Iowa. Investors who want to save for their futures while putting their money to work for the planet don\u2019t just reside on the coasts; it\u2019s been my privilege to have a job where I\u2019m tasked with finding them.<br><br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>I think the controversy around ESG is misguided. Five years ago, I learned that making use of environmental, social and governance factors in your management of a portfolio may help to reduce risk. It\u2019s a data point &#8211; it\u2019s not screening and it\u2019s not shareholder advocacy. Having previously worked in politics, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised at what things get politicized but here we are. I\u2019m sticking to what I originally learned. ESG is a data point, and it shouldn\u2019t be construed as controversial. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/statement-proposed-texas-bill-undermines-insurers-ability-to-fulfill-their-core-mandate-assessing-risk\/\">Check out this statement<\/a> we released when the state of Texas considered legislation that would limit the ability of insurance companies operating in the state to consider environmental risks as determinative factors when underwriting property and casualty risks.<br><br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Commitment matters. Green Century has been helping people save for their futures without compromising their values since 1991. That\u2019s almost 35 years with a consistent approach to screening out the most environmentally dangerous industries and pressing the companies that we own to do better by the planet. We are not new to this, and our commitment has not wavered. In a growing number of investment options and a confusing landscape, our experience and consistency matters. As Leslie recently said, \u201cWe won\u2019t stray from our mission because our values are baked into our DNA.\u201d<br><br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Our ownership structure is unique. We\u2019re owned by public health and environmental nonprofits, and I believe this aspect separates us from others in the field. I\u2019m proud that the profits we generate managing our funds go to organizations who are making a difference on critical issues, not lining the pockets of an executive c-suite. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ownership-6.30.24.pdf\">Check out this piece to learn more.<\/a><br><br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The people in this field are inspiring. The pictures tell the story, and I have hundreds of them on my phone from the events that I\u2019ve done with Green Century.
