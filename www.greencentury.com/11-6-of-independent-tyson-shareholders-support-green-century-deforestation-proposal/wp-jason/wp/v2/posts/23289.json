The Okefenokee is one of the largest freshwater <a href=\"https:\/\/onehundredmiles.org\/okefenokee\/#:~:text=Okefenokee%20is%20the%20largest%20blackwater,an%20ideal%20sanctuary%20for%20wildlife\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wetlands<\/a> in the world, a massive carbon sink, and home to over 1,000 species of plants and animals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cInvestors agree that the Okefenokee is the last place Chemours should set up shop,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century. \u201cMining at this ecological gem would expose the company to a whole host of business risks that, quite simply, aren\u2019t worth the reward.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the letter, investors articulated concerns that mining or purchasing materials mined at the Okefenokee could expose Chemours to undue financial risk including climate and biodiversity risk, regulatory and legal risk, and reputational risk. Numerous independent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wabe.org\/scientists-say-mine-plan-claiming-no-swamp-harm-has-errors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">scientists say<\/a> such mining poses an existential threat to the swamp, and according to a recent poll, nine out of ten Georgia voters are opposed to the mine. The Okefenokee was also <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/okefenokee-wildlife-refuge-unesco-world-heritage-site-499cd975a576658966f7abef26dbba1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nominated<\/a> last year to the UNESCO World Heritage List to join such iconic sites as the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWith growing risks and concerns around sustainable supply chains, we believe any Chemours involvement in mining such a sensitive area, one nominated for the UNESCO World Heritage List, would certainly present risks to the company, investors and this natural treasure,\u201d said Ivan Frishberg, Chief Sustainability Officer for Amalgamated Bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors also raised concerns that Twin Pines Minerals (TPM), a mining company with a prior contractual relationship to Chemours and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajc.com\/news\/investigations\/string-of-environmental-violations-raises-concerns-about-firm-linked-to-okefenokee-mine-project\/HBPFQKRF2VEXDNNVFX57UHFVCQ\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">track record<\/a> of numerous environmental violations, was awarded draft mining permits at the Okefenokee earlier in 2024. The letter also highlighted that TPM\u2019s northern neighbor, Toledo Manufacturing, has publicly called for mining on its land and TPM&#8217;s western neighbor, Rayonier Inc., has leased land to Chemours for titanium mining elsewhere in southeast Georgia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Okefenokee is a precious resource worthy of protection over profit,\u201d said Sister Jean Sliwinski, Provincial Sustainability Coordinator for the Felician Sisters of North America. \u201cWe are grateful for Chemours commitment and ask that they take the next step to prevent mining in this area.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a next step, investors hope to discuss strategies Chemours is undertaking to mitigate risk associated with titanium mining and purchasing titanium mined by others at the Okefenokee, especially in light of the aspiration articulated a recent Chemours Sustainability Report &#8220;to be the most sustainable TiO2 enterprise in the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
