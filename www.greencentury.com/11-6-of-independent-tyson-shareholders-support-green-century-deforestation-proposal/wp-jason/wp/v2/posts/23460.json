That resolution received 56% of shareholder votes cast \u2013 one of the few majority votes on environmental issues in the 2022-2023 U.S. proxy season. Although General Mills has since enhanced some plastics-related disclosures, it neither issued the requested report nor disclosed substantive approaches, targets or plans to reduce its plastic <a href=\"https:\/\/globalresponsibility.generalmills.com\/HTML1\/general_mills-global_responsibility_2024_0054.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">packaging<\/a>.
