In exchange, Green Century and co-filer Boston Common Asset Management agreed to withdraw the proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nature-related risks have emerged as a high priority issue for investors in the last year and we applaud Costco for strengthening its efforts to protect vital habitats around the world, <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, President of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cMillions of Costco members will be gratified to know that their favorite Kirkland Signature items may be moving towards protecting rather than harming tropical forests, home to species from jaguars to giant otters.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Costco says it plans to release its deforestation assessment and action plan by the end of 2025. The disclosure will lay out Costco\u2019s roadmap to protect forests and other natural landscapes from deforestation when sourcing its beef, palm oil, soy and wood products.

While Costco did not commit to fully eliminating deforestation from its Kirkland Signature brand supply chains, the wholesaler stated that it will consider adopting time-bound deforestation- and conversion-free (DCF) commitments for beef, soy, palm oil and\/or wood products in its forthcoming deforestation action plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCostco knows it shouldn\u2019t destroy tropical forests to stock its shelves,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/annie-sanders\/\"><strong>Annie Sanders<\/strong><\/a><strong>, Director of Shareholder Advocacy at Green Century<\/strong>. \u201cWe appreciate this step and encourage the company to further protect global forests by setting time-bound no-deforestation targets across its supply chain.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">###<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><strong>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><!-- \/wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
