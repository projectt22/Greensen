The company\u2019s latest sustainability report disclosed that 60% of the powered lawn care equipment it sold, not including riding lawn mowers, was battery-powered. The information was provided as part of an agreement with Green Century\u00b0, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report highlights the importance of the company ramping up the sale of battery-powered lawn care equipment to meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. The emissions caused by running all 1,745 Lowe\u2019s stores is a tiny fraction of the emissions created by people using the products they purchase at Lowe\u2019s \u2013 less than one half of one percent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cWe are pleased to see that Lowe\u2019s supports the move away from polluting and noisy gas-powered lawn equipment to cleaner and quieter options,\u201d said Leslie Samuelrich, President of Green Century Funds. \u201cBattery-powered lawn equipment is better for investors and the environment, and we encourage Lowe\u2019s\u2019 to build on this momentum.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A few items can have a large climate impact<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Gas-powered lawn care equipment emitted more than 30 million tons of carbon dioxide and nearly 19,000 tons of methane <a href=\"https:\/\/environmentamerica.org\/center\/resources\/lawn-care-goes-electric\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in 2020<\/a> in the U.S. Replacing this equipment with electric alternatives would provide an emissions reduction equivalent to taking as many as 6.5 million gasoline-powered cars <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/greenvehicles\/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=typical%20passenger%20vehicle%3F-,A%20typical%20passenger%20vehicle%20emits%20about%204.6%20metric%20tons%20of,around%2011%2C500%20miles%20per%20year.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">off the road<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cLowe\u2019s has made a commitment to cut its greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said Andrew Shalit, shareholder advocate at Green Century. \u201cThis report makes clear that one of the simplest and fastest way for Lowe\u2019s to do that is to replace gasoline-powered lawnmowers and leaf blowers with cleaner, quieter, electric models.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>States, retailers and reviewers increasingly favor electric products<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>States have begun taking action to limit the sale of gas-powered lawn care equipment or encourage the sale of battery alternatives. California banned the sale of most gasoline-powered <a href=\"https:\/\/ww2.arb.ca.gov\/our-work\/programs\/small-off-road-engines-sore\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawn care equipment<\/a> on January 1, 2024.

Consumer Reports also positively reviews electric models, noting that they are quieter and easier to maintain than their gas-powered counterparts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<br \/>\nAbout Green Century<br \/>\n\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
