While the current CEO will be replaced at the next AGM, to date no board members have indicated they will be resigning to take responsibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On Net Zero, TD Fares Poorly<br><\/strong><br>On net zero, TD fares poorly in a series of independent assessments, and the board is yet to respond to two years of about a quarter of its shareholders expressing concern about its net zero plans. TD currently has three directors \u2013 Claude Mongeau, S. Jane Rowe, and Nancy Tower \u2013 who also serve as directors of fossil fuel companies. A fourth, Brian Ferguson, is an ex-CEO of a fossil fuel company. No TD director has experience with climate solutions.<br><br>Alex Rowe, of Nomura Asset Management UK, with over \u20ac500 billion in AUM, explained their decision to co-file again, this time with an escalated focus on governance:<br>\u201cIn Europe, there is increasing pressure for us to fulfill our own net zero commitments, which means escalating engagements with companies in our portfolio that are failing to progress on their net zero commitments, like TD.\u201d<br><br>Giovanna Eichner of Green Century Capital Management\u00b0, explained:<br>\u201cAs one of the longest-standing sustainable asset managers in North America, we have long understood the value proposition of considering externalities. This is why we want to ensure TD Bank has leadership in place to foresee and manage key existing and emerging risks.\u201d<br><br>Morrigan Simpson-Marran\/ Kelly Hirsch, of Vancity Investment Management explained that:<br>\u201cOur members have made it clear that short-term profits are less important than long-term economic stability and the health of our planet. That is why we encourage companies in our investment portfolio to progress on their net zero commitments. We are now looking for assurance that TD leadership is up to the task.\u201d<br><br>Investors for Paris Compliance works with investors to hold Canadian publicly traded companies accountable to their net zero promises.<\/p>\n<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
