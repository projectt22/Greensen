These days companies have staff who are trained in sustainability. They understand what we\u2019re asking more quickly and are often more receptive to our proposals,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this helps as we give them a nudge from the outside to invest in those changes.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/andrew-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24518\" style=\"width:492px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/andrew-1.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/andrew-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">From 2006-2009, Andrew was the sole full-time shareholder advocate at Green Century. One of his biggest wins involved teaming up with the Investor Environmental Health Network to engage the supermarket giant, Whole Foods. The negotiations targeted the use of bisphenol A, or BPA, a chemical widely used in the manufacturing of clear plastic, including baby bottles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe approached Whole Foods and explained the negative health effects,\u201d he said. \u201cThey agreed to pull the baby bottles. That was the first action by a U.S. company to stop selling products made with BPA.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century has various tactics for corporate engagement, and acts both independently and in tandem with other groups to bring about corporate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSometimes we play a role in between advocacy organizations and companies. We can research issues raised by advocacy organizations and advance these causes in our role as investors,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cWe can also explain the business case for improving their environmental practices.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/andrew-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24517\" style=\"width:460px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/andrew-2.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/andrew-2-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With a chuckle, he draws a contrast from years ago when Green Century functioned as an ally with the nonprofit Greenpeace, which is known for its more strident and dramatic tactics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, the American chemical conglomerate, Dupont, had been targeted by Greenpeace for its storage of chemicals near large U.S. population centers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Dupont manager involved in the discussions said he appreciated Green Century\u2019s approach. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to meet with you, Andrew. Last time I talked to someone from Greenpeace, I ended up handcuffed to him.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew said he\u2019s excited to rejoin Green Century and make a difference with his advocacy efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere is still a lot of work to do, and they still need to hear from Green Century to push their standards and do better.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew lives in the Boston area with his wife and two children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A sustainable investment strategy which incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><a id=\"_msocom_1\"><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
