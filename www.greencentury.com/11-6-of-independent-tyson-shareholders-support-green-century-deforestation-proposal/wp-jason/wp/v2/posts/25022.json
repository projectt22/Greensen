The move came after Green Century Capital Management filed a shareholder proposal asking the company to assess its impact on biodiversity and nature loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe congratulate Bloomin&#8217; Brands on strengthening its forest protection policies,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cWhen you go out for dinner, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry that people are cutting down forests in the Amazon so you can eat your meal.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomin&#8217; Brands owns Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba\u2019s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and several other casual dining chains. Through direct ownership and franchises it is responsible for <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.bloominbrands.com\/static-files\/d653a2f0-ac33-4137-80f8-93636fba2f03\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1,150 restaurants in the United States<\/a> and smaller numbers in other countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beef and Palm Oil Drive Tropical Deforestation<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beef and palm oil production are among the largest reasons for the loss of rainforests worldwide. In exchange for Green Century withdrawing its shareholder proposal, Bloomin&#8217; Brands agreed to strengthen its policies to protect forests when sourcing these ingredients. For the first time, the company will disclose the percentage of beef sourced from Brazil. In addition, Bloomin\u2019 says it will ensure that 60% of that Brazilian beef will come from verified deforestation-free sources. The company says it aims to increase this commitment to 100% in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomin\u2019 will also improve the traceability of its palm oil products and agreed to include biodiversity impacts in the double-materiality assessment it is undertaking in 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Bloomin&#8217; Brands has a significant presence in Brazil, raising the possibility that beef sold in the company\u2019s restaurants contributes to forest loss in the Amazon,&#8221; <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/andrew-shalit\/\"><strong>Andrew Shalit<\/strong><\/a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century<\/strong>. &#8220;We appreciate the company&#8217;s willingness to begin tracking and disclosing its beef sourcing specific to Brazil. We hope this will pave the way for a commitment to 100% deforestation-free beef in the near future.&#8221; Green Century has been pressing Bloomin\u2019 Brands to improve its forest protection policies for several years.
