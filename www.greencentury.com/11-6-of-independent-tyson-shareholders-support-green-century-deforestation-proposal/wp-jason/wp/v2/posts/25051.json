Advocates work on issues such as cutting plastic pollution, protecting forests, promoting clean energy and on other environmental fronts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frances Fairhead-Stanova, who joined the shareholder advocacy team in September, adds an international background and varied experiences to the team. Originally from Cape Town, South Africa, her advocacy work at Green Century focuses on plastics, animal welfare, tackling e-waste and right to repair issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGreen Century has a strong reputation for really effective shareholder engagement,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to work in a place where engagement was a priority and also part of the mission.\u201d<br>Her passion for the environment began as a child. She and her husband are raising their daughter with similar values and respect for the planet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat makes me care about the environment is spending a lot of time in nature growing up in a<br>family that valued and protected the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really inspired by things I see in my everyday life that resonate environmentally. For example, I see excessive use of plastics in packaging at grocery stores.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her shareholder advocacy work has won concessions from companies, such as disclosing how they are investing in new alternatives to plastic packaging. In her work, companies have also agreed to remove misleading recyclable labels from their plastic packaging. These efforts help prevent more plastic waste and help consumers understand the recyclability of their plastic packaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frances said that it is important to research and understand how companies and their customers view sustainability.<br>\u201cSometimes you can help a company understand what its customers are looking for on an issue and how it aligns with their business, even if they don\u2019t realize it yet,&#8221; she said. \u201cRather than just pushing for something, we work to find something that the company can embrace and embed into its strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said she enjoys working with Green Century\u2019s shareholder advocacy team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe people I work with are great and are really dedicated, helpful and effective,&#8221; she said. \u201cThey are great at teaching and growing others. The other part is seeing the outcomes of my work, because that is why I am here.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
