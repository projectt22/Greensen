TD committed to these measures in exchange for Green Century<em>\u00b0<\/em>, Investors for Paris Compliance, and Vancity Investment Management withdrawing a recently filed proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal requested an independent review of TD\u2019s board governance policies and director selection criteria with the aim of improving climate risk management and advancing progress toward the bank\u2019s net-zero goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Banks have a key role to play in the transition to an economy powered by clean energy,\u201d said <strong>Green Century Funds President <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\">Leslie Samuelrich<\/a><\/strong>. \u201cWe applaud TD\u2019s moves to better address climate risk and show investors that the company is taking its net-zero goals seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Significance of Board-Level Climate Expertise and Oversight<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TD\u2019s actions align with calls from investors for companies to show how they plan to meet their net-zero commitments. Because getting to net-zero climate emissions requires businesses to navigate new challenges, incorporating climate expertise at the highest level of corporate decision-making is one critical way companies can show investors they\u2019re up to the task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, Green Century co-filed a resolution pressing TD for more information on how it would meet its climate emissions reduction goals. That proposal earned 28.8% of the shareholder vote, indicating strong interest from investors in the topic and laying the groundwork for this year\u2019s dialogue with the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTD setting a net-zero target was an important initial step toward addressing its contribution to climate change,\u201d <strong>said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate\/\">Giovanna Eichner<\/a>, a shareholder advocate at Green Century<\/strong>. \u201cWe commend the company for now making sure the board is equipped to implement that net-zero goal and more effectively manage climate risk in the years to come.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
