This was the first event that I have been a part of, and it was a wonderful, high-energy day. I talked to individuals with varying backgrounds &#8211; organic farmers, business owners, students, and NOFA CT board members &#8211; all of whom were interested in organic farming and aligned with Green Century\u2019s environmental values. I even met two people who\u2019ve invested with Green Century for years.<br><br><em>A sustainable investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/em><br><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_8254-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25200\" style=\"width:576px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_8254-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_8254-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_8254-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_8254-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/IMG_8254-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><a href=\"Staff Photo\">Staff Photo<\/a>  on <a href=\"archives\">Archives<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent attacks on our nation\u2019s environmental laws that protect the air, water, and lands that we cherish were a popular topic of conversation. Some of the others, including scientists and land conservation workers, feared losing critical federal funding for their climate work. Organic farmers are also being directly impacted by the rollback of environmental policies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and paralyzed by these dynamics. But speaking with the CT NOFA community reminded me of the extensive organic farming, conservation, and environmental work being done across our country that helps create a better future for us all, despite recent policy changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The continuation of all types of environmental work is critical right now. I left feeling inspired, motivated, and grateful to be part of such a unique and impactful company that continues to work hard for positive environmental change. I appreciate NOFA CT for hosting an incredible event and look forward to joining again next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>&#8212; Cecilia Thyen<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a new staff member at Green Century \u00b0, I recently attended the Northeast Organic Farmers Association of Connecticut (CT NOFA) Winter Conference at Eastern Connecticut State University.
