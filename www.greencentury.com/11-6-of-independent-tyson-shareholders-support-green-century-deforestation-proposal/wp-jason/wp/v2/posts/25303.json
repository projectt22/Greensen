The company took this action in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century\u00b0, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Coca-Cola sells beverages in more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/heatherfarmbrough\/2019\/03\/15\/coca-cola-reveals-it-produces-3m-tonnes-of-plastic-packaging-a-year-in-ground-breaking-report\/?sh=315b871e670f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">100 billion plastic bottles<\/a> a year and is the world\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.breakfreefromplastic.org\/2024\/02\/07\/bffp-movement-unveils-2023-global-brand-audit-results\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest plastic polluter<\/a>. However, the company recently reneged on its goals to deliver 25% of beverages in reusable containers by 2030 and to cut 3 million metric tons of new plastic by 2025.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cThough Coca-Cola regrettably abandoned its plastic reduction and reuse goals, this new commitment to disclosing reusable packaging investments and results will help investors track the company\u2019s efforts to mitigate plastic-related risks,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a>,<strong> president of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cWith plastic pollution <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/climate-environment\/2023\/03\/08\/ocean-plastics-pollution-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doubling every six years<\/a> and less than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visualcapitalist.com\/how-much-plastic-gets-recycled\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10% of it<\/a> getting recycled, it\u2019s clear that reuse and reduction are key.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>According to experts, one of the most effective ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/emf.thirdlight.com\/file\/24\/sjZ_pROsjk8VSKPsjXVEszMGHY\/Unlocking%20a%20reuse%20revolution%20-%20scaling%20returnable%20packaging.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduce both plastic use and plastic pollution<\/a> is by replacing single-use plastic containers with reusable ones. Reusable packaging is good for business, too. Studies show that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greensportsalliance.org\/playbooks\/reuse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consumers want<\/a> companies to give them more reusable packaging options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Reuse Disclosure Necessary to Track Coca-Cola\u2019s Efforts to Reduce Single-Use Plastic<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>When Coca-Cola dropped its reuse goal in late 2024, the beverage giant stated that it plans to expand its use of reusable packaging in markets where existing infrastructure can support this important part of its portfolio. Coca-Cola reported that 14% of its beverages were sold in reusable containers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coca-colacompany.com\/content\/dam\/company\/us\/en\/reports\/2023-environmental-update\/2023-environmental-update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in both 2022 and 2023<\/a>, but that the share of Coca-Cola beverages sold in reusable glass bottles <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.coca-colacompany.com\/news-events\/press-releases\/detail\/1128\/coca-cola-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased in 2024<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cWe will be monitoring Coca-Cola\u2019s disclosure on how it is investing in reusables and how this translates into more beverages sold in reusable packaging,\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/frances-fairhead-stanova\/\"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova<\/strong><\/a>, <strong>shareholder advocate with Green Century<\/strong>. \u201cAt the end of the day, investors need these disclosures to ensure Coca-Cola is mitigating the regulatory, reputational and systemic risks posed by its role in the plastic pollution crisis.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Plastic production is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/environment\/plastic-consumption-course-nearly-double-by-2050-research-2023-02-27\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on pace to double by 2050<\/a> without meaningful action to reduce it &#8211; and companies like Coca-Cola can make an outsized impact. Already, the equivalent of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unep.org\/plastic-pollution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic<\/a> end up in our oceans, rivers and lakes every day.
