That\u2019s understandable because there has been a great deal of volatility. But as you probably know, it\u2019s difficult even for professional financial managers to time the market and being out of the market, even for a brief period of time, may be harmful to your long-term performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second reaction is a spike in interest in sustainable investing. We\u2019ve seen a jump in the number of individuals contacting Green Century because they want their future savings to have a positive impact for the environment. Financial advisors we\u2019ve spoken with also report that more people are contacting them because they want to align their investments with their values and make a difference with their money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These stories have been inspiring and confirmed my belief that once people understand the ways they can express their values through their investments, they are eager to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we ride out this volatility, Green Century\u2019s team is working hard to keep your money out of environmentally dangerous companies, improve environmental policies in global corporations, and financially support the environment and public health organizations that founded us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the ways your money is promoting clean energy, reducing plastics and protecting forests, check out new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/impact-reports\/\">Impact Reports<\/a> and let us know what you think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leslie Samuelrich, President<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Green Century Funds<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time in the market, not timing the market is an old adage that I believe is worth sharing right now.
