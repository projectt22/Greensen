The event was inspired by Pope Francis\u2019 call to &#8220;every living person on the planet\u201d to recognize the immediate threat of climate change and to care for the environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>This event brought together priests, nuns, parishioners, students, and even Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, all seemingly united in their commitment to making a positive environmental impact in their communities. The people I spoke with were inspired by the belief that their investments could drive meaningful environmental change, with many attending this gathering to green their parishes. Many expressed frustrations with current practices and voiced concerns about the future of our environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>I decided to work at Green Century because I believe the organization offers an impactful way to address environmental challenges. Green Century rethinks traditional investment systems that too often harm the environment. Instead, Green Century offers people an opportunity to invest in a way that follows their environmental values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>This convocation was a great place for Green Century, not only because I met individuals who have already invested in the funds, but also because the event reflected a shared commitment to change the status quo. The event showcased a 2,000-year-old institution\u2014the Catholic Church\u2014now dedicated to integrating sustainability into its long-standing tradition. To me, this is a powerful symbol of progress and a beacon of hope. It serves as a reminder that, despite our diverse backgrounds and perspectives, our planet is a shared home, and the responsibility to care for it belongs to all of us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>A major part of sustainability is recognizing how we as individuals can act to protect the environment. Green Century is for all types of investors, small and large, and our funds help people invest with their values. I spoke with several people who were interested in environmentally responsible investing as an option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>I left the event energized by the spirit of community and the shared sentiment of making choices and acting in ways to help preserve our planet and conserve our natural resources for future generations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Shea Lyden, Communications and Compliance Coordinator<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently represented Green Century Funds at the Archdiocese of Boston\u2019s 16th Annual Social Justice Convocation.
