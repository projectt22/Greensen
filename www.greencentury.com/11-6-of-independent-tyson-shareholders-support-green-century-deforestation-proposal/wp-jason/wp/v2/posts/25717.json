This benchmark, up from 0% at the end of 2023, is an important step toward the company\u2019s goal to source 100% of its pork that way by 2026 as outlined in an agreement with Green Century\u00b0 in 2023.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The use of gestation crates, which confine pregnant sows for weeks or months at a time, is controversial because it harms animals and can damage the reputations of companies with their customers. Gestation crates are so small that they don\u2019t allow pregnant pigs to turn around. They <a href=\"https:\/\/thehumaneleague.org\/article\/pig-gestation-crates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">harm the animals<\/a> and are considered inhumane. The open pen gestation environments that Jack in the Box is transitioning to provide pigs with enhanced social opportunities, more freedom and space to move, and have been shown to <a href=\"https:\/\/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/articles\/PMC8300341\/#:~:text=Simple%20Summary,sows%20in%20modern%20pig%20production\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improve their health and welfare<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cWe are enthusiastic to see Jack in the Box\u2019s progress on this issue that is of increasing customer and \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2024-03-05\/animal-welfare-is-on-more-proxy-ballots-two-years-after-icahn-s-fight?sref=Brs3FVmA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investor concern<\/a>.

The UK has banned their usage and the EU only allows them for the first four weeks of a sow\u2019s pregnancy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>With its progress, Jack in the Box is catching up to its fast-food peers.
