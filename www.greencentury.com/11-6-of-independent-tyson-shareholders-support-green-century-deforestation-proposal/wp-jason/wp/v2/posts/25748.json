Our partners at Environment America Research &amp; Policy Center have explored several projects across the nation to help reconnect nature.<br><br>The <a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/WEB_AME_Reconnecting-Nature_090121.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reconnecting Nature<\/a> report details possible solutions and ways to think creatively about conserving and connecting habitats that are increasingly divided by human activity. With boundless tracts vanishing, rewilding and reconnecting nature is vital to healthy ecosystems.<br><br>At stake is the ability for species to follow instinctual migration routes, adapt to climate change, forage for food, water, shelter and mates. The report explores wildlife corridors, including seven projects, and demonstrates how connecting fragmented habitats enables species to recover and thrive. Small-scale projects, networks of conservation easements, land management plans and creation of expansive wildlife refuges help conserve wild spaces so animals can move freely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As elk, bobcats, bears, birds and other far-ranging creatures&#8217; cross lands, they encounter barriers that make it harder to access resources and other wildlife. Wild spaces carved up by logging, rangelands, fences and other developments isolate and confine large game animals that need wilderness to thrive and survive. <a href=\"https:\/\/environmentamerica.org\/take-action\/tell-your-legislators-invest-in-wildlife-crossings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Take action here. <br><\/a><br>Building on existing wildlife protections at federal, state and local levels, <a href=\"https:\/\/environmentamerica.org\/center\/articles\/pennsylvania-wildlife-corridors\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wildlife corridors can help with survival during highway crossings<\/a>, adaptation to climate change and animals chasing cooler temperatures, and other diminished habitat.
