Green Century\u00b0, an environmentally responsible mutual fund, and the Felician Sisters of North America filed the proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChemours should more thoroughly assess biodiversity risks before they can\u2019t turn back the clock,\u201d <strong>said Green Century Funds President <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a>. \u201cSince Chemours mines near ecological gems such as the Okefenokee Swamp, taking extra care to prevent irreversible damage to nature is a no-brainer.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chemours, which DuPont spun off in 2015, manufactures and sells \u201cperformance chemicals,\u201d including titanium dioxide, a common whitener in products from toothpaste to sunscreen. Most of Chemours\u2019 mining operations are in the North American Coastal Plain, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cepf.net\/our-work\/biodiversity-hotspots\/north-american-coastal-plain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global biodiversity hotspot<\/a>, where mining-related impacts such as lowered groundwater levels, water pollution and habitat degradation would be particularly destructive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mining in ecologically sensitive areas can drive biodiversity loss and climate change<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overwhelming scientific consensus indicates that mining near the Okefenokee would significantly damage the swamp by drawing down its water level, tripling the frequency of drought and increasing the risk of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/story\/2024-04\/faq-okefenokee-nwr-and-twin-pines-mine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wildfires<\/a>. These repercussions would destroy swamp wildlife habitat, damage thousands of acres of adjacent private timberland and release millions of tons of climate-warming <a href=\"https:\/\/garivers.org\/protectokefenokee-resources\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emissions<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHabitat loss affects not only the land and its inhabitants but also the people who depend on the natural resources,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.felician.org\/2020\/10\/28\/sister-mary-jean-sliwinski\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Sister Jean Sliwinski<\/strong><\/a><strong>, Province Sustainability Coordinator for the Felician Sisters of North America.<\/strong> \u201cA broader, more long-term approach to assessing potential mining impacts is vital.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chemours doesn\u2019t currently assess potentially irreversible biodiversity impacts from its mining operations, lagging a number of peers that do. The company also has a checkered environmental track record that has cost it nearly $1 billion since 2015 for various violations and <a href=\"https:\/\/violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org\/?company_op=starts&amp;company=chemours&amp;offense_group=environment-related+offenses&amp;agency_code=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spills<\/a>. The recently voted-on proposal argued that an enhanced biodiversity assessment policy would reduce systemic, financial and competitive risks for the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would say that slightly whiter toothpaste is worth irreversible biodiversity loss,\u201d <strong>said Green Century Director of Shareholder Advocacy <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/annie-sanders\/\"><strong>Annie Sanders<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> \u201cWe&#8217;ll keep pressing Chemours to ensure that it considers and protects biodiversity before mining starts. That\u2019s what\u2019s best for investors, customers, and the planet.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong><em>About Green Century <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
