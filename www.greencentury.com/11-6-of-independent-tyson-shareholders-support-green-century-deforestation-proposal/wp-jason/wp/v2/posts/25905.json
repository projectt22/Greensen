Smucker*, parent company of Folgers, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin\u2019 at Home coffee products, has agreed to review its forest protection policies with an ambition of eventually sourcing all of its ingredients without any collateral deforestation. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century Capital Management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs investors, we encourage companies to reduce their material risks and improve their environmental impact,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cWe hope Smuckers\u2019 will follow up its research swiftly with a commitment to source coffee and other ingredients from verified deforestation-free sources.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>J.M. Smucker is the largest seller of at-home coffee in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jmsmucker.com\/brands-you-love\/coffee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United States<\/a>. It also produces its namesake jellies, Hostess Twinkies, Milk Bone dog biscuits, and a wide range of other popular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jmsmucker.com\/brands-you-love\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">snack and pet foods<\/a>. Coffee and other agricultural products are among the largest drivers of global <a href=\"https:\/\/perfectdailygrind.com\/2022\/06\/deforestation-in-coffee-production\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">deforestation<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Assessment followed by commitment<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of its agreement with Green Century, in 2025, J.M. Smucker will assess the steps necessary to ensure the company uses deforestation-free supplies of coffee, palm, soy and cocoa, as well as wood pulp used in packaging. The company plans to follow the assessment with a transition to deforestation-free supplies in 2026, as commercially feasible. Any policy adopted will include ongoing third-party assurance of forest protection practices as well as a grievance system for reporting violations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Forest protection is climate protection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deforestation and destruction of other natural habitats is responsible for <a href=\"https:\/\/sciencebasedtargets.org\/blog\/forest-land-and-agriculture-pathways-will-require-action-on-deforestation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions<\/a>. Forests can also play an important role in removing carbon from the atmosphere, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.woodwellclimate.org\/global-forest-carbon-storage-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">but only if they are allowed to grow and thrive<\/a>. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fao.org\/newsroom\/detail\/cop26-agricultural-expansion-drives-almost-90-percent-of-global-deforestation\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">greatest driver of deforestation globally is agriculture<\/a>, making it critical for food companies to commit to deforestation-free ingredients. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;J.M. Smucker has woken up and smelled the coffee,&#8221; <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/andrew-shalit\/\"><strong>Andrew Shalit<\/strong><\/a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century<\/strong>. &#8220;American consumers love their morning joe and they also want to protect the environment. These steps will help J.M. Smucker do both things, and provide sustainable coffee, snacks, and pet products.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
