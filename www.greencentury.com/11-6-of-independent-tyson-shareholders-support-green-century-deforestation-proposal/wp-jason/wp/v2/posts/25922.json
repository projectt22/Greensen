KDP made this commitment in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century\u00b0, an environmentally responsible mutual fund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cInvesting in more sustainable packaging is a commitment that consumers and investors are increasingly looking for,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cGiven the reputational and legal risks associated with plastic packaging and misleading recycling labeling, Keurig Dr. Pepper should accelerate its transition to more sustainable options as soon as possible.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>KDP has agreed to provide consumers with information on whether their communities accept K-Cup pods for recycling. The company will also make it easier for readers of its sustainability report to understand what it classifies as recyclable. Finally, KDP has agreed to provide more information on the development of its K-Round system, which would make single-serve coffee in compostable, plant-based pods instead of plastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>What does it mean to be recyclable?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>According to the Federal Trade Commissions\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/federal_register_notices\/guides-use-environmental-marketing-claims-green-guides\/greenguidesfrn.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Green Guides<\/a>, an item is recyclable if it can be \u201ccollected, separated, or otherwise recovered from the waste stream through an established recycling program for reuse or use in manufacturing or assembling another item.\u201d In other words, a community must accept it for recycling collection and sufficient end markets must exist to turn the material into recycled plastic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>K-Cup pods are made from polypropylene, a material that <a href=\"https:\/\/recyclingpartnership.org\/Polypropylene-Recycling-Coalition-Annual-Report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than half of Americans can put in their curbside recycling bins<\/a>. However, far fewer communities accept these pods because they are hard to sort because they are so small. A <a href=\"https:\/\/storage.googleapis.com\/planet4-usa-stateless\/2024\/11\/7287b658-gpus_finalreport_2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2022 Greenpeace report<\/a> found that only 1 out of the 375 material recovering facilities (MRF\u2019s) included in the study accepted coffee pods made from polypropylene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>KDP has faced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/sec-keurig-dr-pepper-recyclability-settlement-coffee-k-pods\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lawsuits<\/a> over its recyclability claims and was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2024-122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fined by the SEC<\/a> for misleading shareholders about the recyclability of its K-Cup pods. California already regulates recyclability claims made by companies, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/calrecycle.ca.gov\/wcs\/recyclinglabels\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new law<\/a> taking effect there in October 2026 that strengthens regulation of recyclability claims.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cWe hope this move by KDP will make it easier for customers to access information on the recyclability of K-Cup pods in their communities,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/frances-fairhead-stanova\/\"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova<\/strong><\/a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century.<\/strong>. \u201cWe encourage the company to provide access to this information directly on its packaging.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
