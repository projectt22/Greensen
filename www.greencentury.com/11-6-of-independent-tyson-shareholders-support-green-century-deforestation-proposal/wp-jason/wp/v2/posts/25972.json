The proposal asked the company to assess its impact on nature and the systemic risks posed to the company by those impacts on the world around us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPepsiCo relies on nature for all the ingredients that go into its products, from corn and spices to fresh water,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.<\/strong> \u201cThe company needs to do everything possible to ensure it\u2019s not hurting healthy ecosystems.

Yet, the reliability of these inputs is increasingly uncertain. The United States incurred more than <a href=\"https:\/\/grist.org\/food-and-agriculture\/the-20-billion-question-hanging-over-americas-struggling-farmers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$20 billion in crop losses last year because of extreme weather<\/a>. In addition, the global decline in pollinators has destabilized crop yields across two-thirds of the world. The <a href=\"https:\/\/octopart.com\/pulse\/p\/extreme-weather-becomes-new-supply-chain-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disruption of nature <\/a>also impacts the <a href=\"https:\/\/e360.yale.edu\/features\/how-climate-change-is-disrupting-the-global-supply-chain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transportation systems <\/a>that companies such as PepsiCo use to bring products to market. In 2024, wildfires, hurricanes and floods <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freightwaves.com\/news\/weathers-wrath-supply-chains-reel-from-2024s-extreme-events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shut down transport systems around the globe<\/a>, causing major disruptions in Canada, Mexico, China and Malaysia, among other places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Investors want transparency re: Pepsi\u2019s impacts on nature<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second year that Green Century has offered PepsiCo\u2019s shareholders a proposal on biodiversity impacts. This year\u2019s proposal was supported by 17.7% of PepsiCo shareholders. This vote will allow the resolution to be submitted again next year if the company does not take action. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe hope that PepsiCo will hear the message of its shareholders: nature matters,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/andrew-shalit\/\"><strong>Andrew Shalit<\/strong><\/a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century. <\/strong>\u201cInvestors shouldn\u2019t have to stay up at night wondering whether our company is putting critical ecosystems at risk to sell Doritos and Mountain Dew.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
