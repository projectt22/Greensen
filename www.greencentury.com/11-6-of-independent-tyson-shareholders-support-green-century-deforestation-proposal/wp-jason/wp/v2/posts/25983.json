Ford\u2019s supply chain, which provides steel, aluminum and batteries, among other materials, <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.ford.com\/content\/dam\/corporate\/us\/en-us\/documents\/reports\/2024-integrated-sustainability-and-financial-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">represents 11%<\/a> of the company\u2019s impact on climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Descendants of company founder Henry Ford own a special class of stock that gives them 40% of the voting <a href=\"https:\/\/quartr.com\/insights\/business-philosophy\/the-ford-family-a-permanent-mark-in-business-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">power<\/a> on shareholder proposals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re glad to see many independent investors asking Ford to better address the climate impact of its supply chain,\u201d <strong>said Green Century Funds president <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> \u201cBy investing more in sustainable materials to make its vehicles, Ford could assure shareholders it\u2019s prepared to more fully mitigate climate-related risks.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steel and aluminum are big climate polluters<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The climate impact of Ford\u2019s supply chain mainly comes from materials such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S2214629622000706\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steel<\/a> (a metal mostly composed of carbon and iron) and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/decarbonizing-aluminum-rolling-out-more-sustainable-sector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aluminum<\/a>, the production of which are responsible for approximately 10% of global climate emissions. The auto industry is the second-largest consumer of steel, procuring <a href=\"https:\/\/theicct.org\/publication\/green-steel-automakers-us-europe-sep-24\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12%<\/a> of global supply, and is the largest aluminum buyer in the <a href=\"https:\/\/leadthecharge.org\/the-problem\/aluminum\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">world<\/a>. Alternatives such as <a href=\"https:\/\/theicct.org\/publication\/technologies-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-automotive-steel-US-EU-jul24\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">low-carbon steel<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/international-aluminium.org\/landing\/as-well-as-aluminium-recycling-saving-95-of-the-energy-needed-for-primary-aluminium-production-the-recycling-process-saves-a-similar-percentage-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recycled aluminum<\/a> can reduce climate emissions from each material by over 95%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ford aims to be climate neutral by 2050, but lacks a plan for its supply chain<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A comprehensive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/climateleadership\/climate-transition-planning#what\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">climate transition plan<\/a> should describe the strategies, milestones, and timelines for a company to deliver on its decarbonization targets. It also includes progress reporting. Green Century\u2019s proposal argued that these steps are as necessary for Ford\u2019s supply chain as they are for its other emissions sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford aims to have net zero emissions by 2035 in Europe and by 2050 globally to tackle <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.ford.com\/content\/dam\/corporate\/us\/en-us\/documents\/reports\/2024-integrated-sustainability-and-financial-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">climate change<\/a>, which the company <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.ford.com\/content\/dam\/corporate\/us\/en-us\/documents\/reports\/2024-integrated-sustainability-and-financial-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">acknowledges<\/a> is \u201cone of the biggest challenges of our generation.\u201d To meet those targets, Ford will need to significantly scale up procurement of low-emissions steel and aluminum from its <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.ford.com\/content\/dam\/corporate\/us\/en-us\/documents\/reports\/2024-integrated-sustainability-and-financial-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">current target<\/a> of 10% by 2030, among other steps. And while Ford has outlined detailed climate emissions reduction efforts for its operations and vehicle use, it hasn\u2019t disclosed similar targets or plans for its supply chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ford has taken important steps, but more work is needed<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford has adopted some policies to cut supply chain emissions, including target-setting requirements for its suppliers and several nonbinding agreements with low-carbon steel suppliers signed in <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.ford.com\/content\/dam\/corporate\/us\/en-us\/documents\/reports\/2024-integrated-sustainability-and-financial-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2022<\/a>. However, the second-largest U.S. auto maker has yet to report on results or incorporate those steps into a supply chain emissions reduction plan that charts a path to its net zero goals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Competitors such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.volkswagen-group.com\/en\/publications\/more\/group-sustainability-report-2023-2674\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volkswagen<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmwgroup.com\/content\/dam\/grpw\/websites\/bmwgroup_com\/ir\/downloads\/en\/2025\/bericht\/BMW-Group-Report-2024-en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BMW<\/a> disclose supply chain climate emissions reduction targets and plans, and additional companies including <a href=\"https:\/\/stegra.com\/news-and-stories\/mercedes-benz-and-h2-green-steel-announce-agreements-in-both-europe-and-north-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stegra.com\/news-and-stories\/h2-green-steel-collaborates-with-volvo-group-for-supply-of-near-zero-emissions-steel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volvo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.porsche.com\/en\/2023\/sustainability\/porsche-co2-reduced-steel-in-sports-cars-34225.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Porsche<\/a> have locked in supplies of more sustainable steel. Ford\u2019s lack of a plan to fully mitigate its contribution to climate change may harm its image and credibility so as to become a factor in customer purchasing decisions, particularly in Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re Mad Max, you can\u2019t drive a Ford on a burning planet,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/annie-sanders\/\"><strong>Annie Sanders<\/strong><\/a><strong>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century.<\/strong> \u201cIt\u2019s time for Ford to clean up its supply chain in line with its own net zero goals and investor expectations.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong><em>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>About Green Century <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
