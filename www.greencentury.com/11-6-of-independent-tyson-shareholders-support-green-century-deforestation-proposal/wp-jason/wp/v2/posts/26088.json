The semiconductor manufacturer supplies major technology companies including Apple* , Google* and Microsoft* with materials that power billions of electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cInvestors need a more complete understanding of a business\u2019 contribution and exposure to climate risk to understand potential effects on their investments,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/leslie-samuelrich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds. <\/strong>\u201cBy disclosing the majority of its emissions, Skyworks would catch up to industry standards and meet investor expectations.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skyworks lags competitors and customers on climate ambition<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The semiconductor industry accounted for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/publications\/2023\/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as much climate pollution as half of U.S. households<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/publications\/2023\/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> combined<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/publications\/2023\/why-chip-makers-need-to-focus-on-the-upcoming-decarbonization-challenges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> in 2023<\/a>. About <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/publications\/2023\/a-plan-to-reduce-semiconductor-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80% of a semiconductor\u2019s climate footprint<\/a> comes from across its supply chain, including raw materials and device use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of Skyworks\u2019 peers are reducing their impact on climate change. NXP Semiconductors* and Applied Materials* are among more than <a href=\"https:\/\/sciencebasedtargets.org\/target-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10,000 companies<\/a> that have set science-based climate emissions reduction targets. In addition, more than 60 semiconductor companies founded the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semi.org\/en\/industry-groups\/semiconductor-climate-consortium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Semiconductor Climate Consortium<\/a> to mitigate emissions from the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skyworks\u2019 largest customers also surpass the company in their climate commitments. Apple, which <a href=\"https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/news\/4405602-skyworks-solutions-downgraded-at-argus-on-apple-worries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">accounted for 69% of Skyworks\u2019 net revenue<\/a> in 2024, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2020\/07\/apple-commits-to-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral-for-its-supply-chain-and-products-by-2030\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aims to be carbon neutral by 2030<\/a>, and other customers such as <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.aboutamazon.com\/climate-solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/blog\/2020\/01\/16\/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sustainability.google\/operating-sustainably\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a> have equally ambitious targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Disclosing climate emissions increases transparency and drives action<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Measuring full value-chain emissions helps companies identify the largest sources of greenhouse gases across their operations and supply chain. It is also a crucial first step toward setting targets and implementing actions to reduce emissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Skyworks has disclosed its operational emissions and emissions from business travel, these are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nxp.com\/company\/about-nxp\/sustainability\/environment-health-and-safety\/emissions:EMISSIONS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">likely<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nxp.com\/company\/about-nxp\/sustainability\/environment-health-and-safety\/emissions:EMISSIONS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> to account for less than 10%<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nxp.com\/company\/about-nxp\/sustainability\/environment-health-and-safety\/emissions:EMISSIONS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <\/a>of the company\u2019s overall impact on climate change based on competitors\u2019 disclosures. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appliedmaterials.com\/eu\/en\/corporate-responsibility\/planet\/net-zero.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Peers that report a more complete emissions inventory<\/a> show that supply-chain and device use emissions typically comprise more than 90% of a semiconductor\u2019s climate impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSkyworks disclosing its full value-chain emissions would signal its intent to catch up to competitors and meet its customers\u2019 expectations for climate action,\u201d <strong>said Green Century <\/strong><strong>Shareholder Advocate <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/giovanna-eichner-shareholder-advocate\/\"><strong>Giovanna Eichner<\/strong><\/a>. \u201cContinuing to trail the industry creates reputational, competitive, and climate risks that threaten its bottom line and the planet.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>About Green Century Funds <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
