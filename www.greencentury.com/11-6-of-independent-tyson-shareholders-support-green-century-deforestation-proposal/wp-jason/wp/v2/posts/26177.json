Company shareholders voted on the proposal at the company\u2019s annual meeting Thursday. The proposal received 17% of votes cast, more than a similar proposal received at the company\u2019s 2024 stockholder meeting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHome Depot sells lumber, paints, and herbicides, all of which adversely impact the environment, during either production or use,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds.<\/strong> \u201cThe company has a responsibility to shareholders and the planet to account for how its business affects nature.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Investors concerned about the health of the natural world<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Climate change, pollution and overexploitation of natural resources are stressing the planet.

In her remarks, Simard, a professor of forest ecology, described the important role of forests in mitigating climate change and how industrial logging degrades the health of forests.
