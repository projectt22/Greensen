In part, the proposal urged Walmart to reduce its plastic packaging and ensure its recycling labels don\u2019t mislead consumers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cPlastic pollution is harming our oceans, our wildlife and our health,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/publicinterestnetwork.org\/people\/leslie-samuelrich\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds<\/strong>.. \u201cWalmart\u2019s investors have sent a message that the company cannot recycle its way out of the plastic pollution problem. It\u2019s a material risk that concerns investors.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The UN Environment Programme estimates that the social and environmental <a href=\"https:\/\/wedocs.unep.org\/bitstream\/handle\/20.500.11822\/42277\/Plastic_pollution.pdf?sequence=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costs of plastic pollution<\/a> are between $300 and 600 billion dollars per year. This includes costs to human health, the costs of ocean clean-ups and lost marine ecosystem services such as food production and recreation. Although recycling has often been elevated as the solution to global plastic pollution, experts agree it is reducing plastic use that is key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Walmart set a <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.walmart.com\/purpose\/esgreport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goal to reduce its use of virgin plastic<\/a> in its private brand packaging by 15% by 2025 from 2020 levels, but as of 2023, its use of virgin plastic for private brand packaging had increased by 6%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Studies show that consumers increasingly want to be offered products in reusable packaging, and that reusable packaging is one of the most <a href=\"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/stories\/2025\/01\/tipping-point-year-for-reusable-packaging-systems\/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20United%20Nations,into%20the%20environment%20by%202040\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">effective ways to reduce plastic pollution<\/a>. However, Walmart does not disclose information about reusable packaging initiatives in its <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.walmart.com\/purpose\/esgreport\/environmental\/waste-circular-economy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sustainability report<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Beyond failing to disclose effective strategies to reduce its use of plastic packaging, Walmart uses labels with misleading recyclability claims on its plastic packaging, including the \u201cStore Drop Off\u201d label. According to investigations conducted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2023-09-29\/us-store-drop-off-plastic-recycling-often-ends-up-in-landfills?sref=Brs3FVmA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/put-dozens-trackers-plastic-bags-recycling-trashed\/story?id=99509422\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ABC<\/a>, the majority of plastic bags and films deposited in \u201cStore Drop Off bins\u201d are sent to landfills or incinerated, not recycled. As a result, some major brands such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mondelezinternational.com\/snacking-made-right\/esg-topics\/recyclability-communication\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mondelez<\/a> have publicly committed to stop using the \u201cStore Drop Off\u201d label while <a href=\"https:\/\/grist.org\/accountability\/amazon-says-its-plastic-packaging-can-be-recycled-an-investigation-finds-it-usually-isnt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">other brands<\/a> have quietly stopped using it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cWithout action from companies such as Walmart, the impacts of plastic on our environment and the risks to human health will only increase,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/frances-fairhead-stanova\/\"><strong>Frances Fairhead-Stanova<\/strong><\/a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century<\/strong>. \u201cInvestors understand this and have sent a clear message to Walmart: It is time to stop messing around with labels and reduce plastic pollution.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>About Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
