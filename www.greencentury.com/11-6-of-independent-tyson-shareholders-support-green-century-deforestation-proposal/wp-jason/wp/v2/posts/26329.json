GM&#8217;s supply chain, which includes steel, aluminum and batteries, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gm.com\/content\/dam\/company\/docs\/us\/en\/gmcom\/company\/GM_2023_SR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">represents 16%<\/a> of the company\u2019s impact on climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cInvestors want to know how General Motors is addressing the climate impact of its supply chain,\u201d <strong>said Green Century Funds president <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> \u201cWithout a roadmap to cut these emissions, it\u2019s unclear to investors how GM plans to mitigate climate-related risks in line with its zero emissions ambition.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Steel and aluminum are major climate polluters<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The climate impact of GM&#8217;s supply chain mainly comes from materials such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S2214629622000706\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">steel<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/decarbonizing-aluminum-rolling-out-more-sustainable-sector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aluminum<\/a>, the production of which is responsible for approximately 10% of global climate emissions. The auto industry is the second-largest consumer of steel, procuring <a href=\"https:\/\/theicct.org\/publication\/green-steel-automakers-us-europe-sep-24\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">12%<\/a> of global supply, and is the largest aluminum buyer in the <a href=\"https:\/\/leadthecharge.org\/the-problem\/aluminum\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">world<\/a>. Alternatives such as <a href=\"https:\/\/theicct.org\/publication\/technologies-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-automotive-steel-US-EU-jul24\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">low-carbon steel<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/international-aluminium.org\/landing\/as-well-as-aluminium-recycling-saving-95-of-the-energy-needed-for-primary-aluminium-production-the-recycling-process-saves-a-similar-percentage-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recycled aluminum<\/a> can reduce climate emissions from each material by over 95%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>GM aims for zero emissions, but lacks a plan for its supply chain<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A comprehensive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/climateleadership\/climate-transition-planning#what\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">climate transition plan<\/a> should describe the strategies, milestones, and timelines for a company to deliver on its decarbonization targets. It also includes progress reporting. Green Century\u2019s proposal argued that these steps are as necessary for GM&#8217;s supply chain as they are for its other emissions sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve zero emissions, GM will need to significantly scale up procurement of low-emissions steel and aluminum from its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gm.com\/content\/dam\/company\/docs\/us\/en\/gmcom\/company\/GM_2023_SR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">current target<\/a> of 10% by 2030, among other steps. And while GM has outlined detailed climate emissions reduction efforts for its operations and vehicle use, it hasn\u2019t disclosed similar targets or plans for its supply chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GM has taken some steps to cut supply chain emissions, including target-setting requirements for its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gm.com\/content\/dam\/company\/docs\/us\/en\/gmcom\/company\/GM_2023_SR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suppliers<\/a>. However, the largest U.S. auto maker has yet to report on results or incorporate existing steps into a supply chain emissions reduction plan that charts a path to zero emissions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Competitors are doing more to reduce supply chain emissions<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Competitors such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.volkswagen-group.com\/en\/publications\/more\/group-sustainability-report-2023-2674\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volkswagen<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmwgroup.com\/content\/dam\/grpw\/websites\/bmwgroup_com\/ir\/downloads\/en\/2025\/bericht\/BMW-Group-Report-2024-en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BMW<\/a> disclose supply chain climate emissions reduction targets and plans, and additional companies including <a href=\"https:\/\/stegra.com\/news-and-stories\/mercedes-benz-and-h2-green-steel-announce-agreements-in-both-europe-and-north-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mercedes<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/stegra.com\/news-and-stories\/h2-green-steel-collaborates-with-volvo-group-for-supply-of-near-zero-emissions-steel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Volvo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.porsche.com\/en\/2023\/sustainability\/porsche-co2-reduced-steel-in-sports-cars-34225.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Porsche<\/a> have locked in supplies of more sustainable steel. GM&#8217;s lack of a plan to fully mitigate its contribution to climate change may harm its image and credibility so as to become a factor in customer purchasing decisions, particularly in Europe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for GM to apply the same rigor to cutting supply chain emissions that it musters for its other business goals,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/annie-sanders\/\"><strong>Annie Sanders<\/strong><\/a><strong>, director of shareholder advocacy at Green Century.<\/strong> \u201cInvestors expect nothing less from a company that aims to lead the automotive industry in creating a world with zero emissions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>About Green Century Funds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
