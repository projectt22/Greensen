The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century\u00b0, which withdrew the proposal in exchange for Amcor\u2019s commitment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cWe applaud Amcor for taking steps to ensure its recycled content claims aren\u2019t misleading,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a>,\u00a0<strong>President of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cInvestors need comprehensive and transparent disclosure of business risks in order to protect their investments.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Recycled content is good \u2013 but \u2018mass balance accounting\u2019 obscures the facts<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The use of recycled content in packaging is a key way to prevent new plastic from entering the environment. However, some companies, including Amcor, use a method called \u201cmass balance accounting\u201d to calculate recycled content. This alternative method can be used by companies to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nrdc.org\/bio\/renee-sharp\/plastics-industrys-latest-deception-mass-balance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">claim that a majority of a piece of packaging is made from recycled content<\/a> in cases when traditional accounting methods would put that number at less than 10%. Consequently, mass balance accounting is potentially misleading to consumers, which can create compliance risks for companies since misleading environmental claims are illegal in the <a href=\"https:\/\/earth.org\/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-eus-new-greenwashing-directive\/#:~:text=The%20legislation%20explicitly%20prohibits%20companies,respect%20of%20their%20environmental%20commitments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European Union<\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.novata.com\/resources\/blog\/regulatory-update-uk-sdr-anti-greenwashing-rules\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Kingdom<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/competition-bureau.canada.ca\/en\/how-we-foster-competition\/education-and-outreach\/environmental-claims-and-greenwashing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canada<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.steptoe.com\/a\/web\/195909\/NavigatingFTCGuidance.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">five U.S. states<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Effective solutions for plastics<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Companies use mass balance recycled content claims, in part, because <a href=\"https:\/\/repurpose.global\/blog\/post\/consumers-are-driving-action-on-plastic-waste#:~:text=Ocean%20pollution%20is%20the%20most%20pressing%20environmental%20issue%20for%20younger%20generations.&amp;text=Around%204%20in%205%20(83,if%20they%20don&#039;t%20recycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consumers increasingly<\/a>\u00a0are concerned about plastic. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surfrider.org\/initiatives\/plastic-pollution#:~:text=An%20estimated%2011%20million%20tons,currently%20doubling%20every%20six%20years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plastic pollution has been doubling<\/a> every six years in our world\u2019s oceans, where it kills thousands of marine animals every year.
