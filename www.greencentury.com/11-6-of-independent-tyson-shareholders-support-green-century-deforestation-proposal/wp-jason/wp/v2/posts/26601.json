The company says it will include the results of the assessment in its 2025 citizenship report.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFood companies are increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment where they source their ingredients. It\u2019s a crucial part of keeping their supply chain stable,\u201d <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/leslie-samuelrich\/\"><strong>Leslie Samuelrich<\/strong><\/a><strong>, president of Green Century Funds<\/strong>. \u201cWe hope Conagra quickly follows its assessment with a commitment to protect these biodiverse regions.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Natural environments under continued threat<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agricultural production is the leading driver of ecosystem destruction in regions such as the Cerrado in Brazil and Gran Chaco, which covers parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Argentina.

This has led to biodiversity loss and undermined critical aspects of ecosystem reliability, such as rainfall patterns and fresh water availability. Conversion of natural environments to other uses is also a major source of carbon emissions, which elevate the risk of disruptive effects of climate change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From forest protection to nature protection<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conagra agreed to adopt a no-deforestation policy in response to a shareholder resolution filed by Green Century in 2022. That policy does not, however, cover non-forest natural areas. This new agreement reaffirms the company\u2019s commitment to work toward protections for other critical ecosystems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Cerrado is home to more than 800 species of birds,&#8221; <strong>said <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/team\/andrew-shalit\/\"><strong>Andrew Shalit<\/strong><\/a><strong>, shareholder advocate at Green Century<\/strong>. &#8220;It\u2019s fitting that the parent company of Birds Eye will do what it can to protect the birds of the Cerrado, along with all the diversity of life found there.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>###<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p><strong>An investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance criteria may result in lower or higher returns than an investment strategy that does not include such criteria.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>About Green Century<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
