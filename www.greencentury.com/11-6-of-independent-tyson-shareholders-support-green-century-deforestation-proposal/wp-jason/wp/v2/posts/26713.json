The Conservation Fund recently purchased nearly 8,000 acres of land near the Okefenokee for abou<a href=\"https:\/\/environmentamerica.org\/articles\/why-georgias-okefenokee-swamp-needs-protection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">t $60 million from Twin Pines Minerals LLC.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a monumental win not only for the state of Georgia, but for all those who voiced support for these wetlands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For each of the past four years, Green Century\u2019s award-winning shareholder advocacy team has opposed a proposed titanium mine in this wildlife haven that boasts the largest freshwater swamp in the country. &nbsp;Green Century\u2019s efforts to protect this natural treasure include<ins>d<\/ins> filing shareholder resolutions, speaking with the media, and holding several webinars to highlight its importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Okefenokee is the largest wildlife refuge in the Eastern United States and provides critical habitat to more than 400 animal species. The swamp is also a massive carbon sink, holding more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selc.org\/topic\/protecting-the-okefenokee-swamp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">140 million tons of carbon dioxide<\/a>, which is roughly equivalent to the emissions from 30 million cars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, Twin Pines Minerals sought permits to mine titanium dioxide\u2014a white pigment used in paint<del>s<\/del>, toothpaste, and sunscreen<del>s<\/del>\u2014on lands bordering the swamp. &nbsp;In 2022, Green Century secured a commitment from Chemours*, a chemical company linked to Twin Pines, to refrain from mining in the area in the near term. Mining operations there pose severe threats to the swamp and its surrounding ecosystems, including water pollution, soil degradation, and the destruction of critical wildlife habitats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;In 2025, Green Century again pressed Chemours to avoid mining at the Okefenokee by filing a shareholder proposal asking for a biodiversity assessment before the company mines in ecologically sensitive areas. The proposal won enough support to refile in future years and raised important visibility for the issue among investors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;This and other Green Century wins demonstrate the power that shareholder advocacy wields. &nbsp;Green Century is ready to take on the next challenge and will continue leveraging our investors&#8217; support to hold global corporations accountable and protect our environment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Green Century\u2019s shareholder advocacy team as well as religious, legal, and other groups helped amplify a public outcry that halted a proposed mine near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, a [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":21,"featured_media":25127,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"rank_math_lock_modified_date":false,"_EventAllDay":false,"_EventTimezone":"","_EventStartDate":"","_EventEndDate":"","_EventStartDateUTC":"","_EventEndDateUTC":"","_EventShowMap":false,"_EventShowMapLink":false,"_EventURL":"","_EventCost":"","_EventCostDescription":"","_EventCurrencySymbol":"","_EventCurrencyCode":"","_EventCurrencyPosition":"","_EventDateTimeSeparator":"","_EventTimeRangeSeparator":"","_EventOrganizerID":[],"_EventVenueID":[],"_OrganizerEmail":"","_OrganizerPhone":"","_OrganizerWebsite":"","_VenueAddress":"","_VenueCity":"","_VenueCountry":"","_VenueProvince":"","_VenueState":"","_VenueZip":"","_VenuePhone":"","_VenueURL":"","_VenueStateProvince":"","_VenueLat":"","_VenueLng":"","_VenueShowMap":false,"_VenueShowMapLink":false,"_tribe_blocks_recurrence_rules":"","_tribe_blocks_recurrence_description":"","_tribe_blocks_recurrence_exclusions":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[310],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/26713"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/21"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=26713"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/26713\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":26714,"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/26713\/revisions\/26714"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/25127"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=26713"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=26713"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=26713"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
