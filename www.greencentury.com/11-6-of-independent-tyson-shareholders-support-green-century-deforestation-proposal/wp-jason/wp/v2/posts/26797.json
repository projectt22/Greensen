We also saw 18 policies implemented that companies had previously committed to adopting this year \u2013 thanks to our advocacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are our Top Ten Highlights from the 2025 Shareholder Advocacy Season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"518\" height=\"345\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26810\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy.jpeg 518w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED-Copy-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>10. Preserving Forests: J.M. Smucker*, parent company of Folgers and Dunkin\u2019 at Home coffee products, agreed to review its forest protection policies with an ambition of eventually sourcing all of its ingredients without causing any deforestation. The move came in response to a shareholder proposal from Green Century\u00b0, which requested that the company ensure its supplies of coffee, palm, soy and cocoa, as well as wood pulp used for its packaging, are deforestation free. The company plans to follow the assessment with a transition to deforestation-free supplies in 2026.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"551\" height=\"367\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26807\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1.jpeg 551w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED1-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>9. Safeguarding Animal Welfare: Green Century filed a shareholder proposal asking Darden Restaurants* to eliminate the use of gestation crates for pigs. Gestation crates are considered inhumane and enable factory farming systems that increase pollution. The resolution received a significant 20% vote in support from investors and, if adopted, would put Darden on par with companies such as Bloomin&#8217; Brands<em>, Costco<\/em> and Target* that are phasing out gestation crates in their supply chains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"512\" height=\"341\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26806\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3.jpeg 512w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED3-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>8. Protecting Biodiversity: Green Century filed a shareholder resolution at Conagra* urging the packaged food company to strengthen protections for wild lands as it sources ingredients such as beef and soy. In exchange for withdrawal of our shareholder proposal, Conagra committed to assessing more protections for biodiverse ecosystems such as grasslands and savannahs affected by its global supply chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"537\" height=\"358\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26805\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4.jpeg 537w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED4-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>7. Disclosing Climate Impact: In response to a Green Century shareholder proposal and subsequent agreement, Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement* released climate emissions data from the products it sells. These new disclosures represent 84% of Lowe\u2019s contribution to climate change and will show investors the categories that represent the biggest polluters, allowing stakeholders to press the company more effectively on how it plans to mitigate its climate impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"487\" height=\"323\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26804\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5.jpeg 487w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED5-300x199.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>6. Stopping Plastic Pollution: Green Century reached an agreement with Starbucks* to ensure the coffee behemoth provides accurate information about the recyclability of its plastic cups and shares details about its transition to reusable cups by early 2026. Sealed Air*<em>, the packaging company that sells BUBBLE WRAP\u00ae and air pillows, <\/em>and packaging company Amcor* also agreed to improve the sustainability of their packaging to ensure their recycling labels do not mislead consumers. All three commitments came after Green Century agreed to withdraw related shareholder proposals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"543\" height=\"362\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26803\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6.jpeg 543w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED6-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Protecting Farm Animal Welfare: Jack in the Box* hit its benchmark to source 25% of its pork from pigs raised in \u201copen pens\u201d instead of gestation crates by the end of 2024. This interim target, up from 0% at the end of 2023, is an important step toward the company\u2019s goal to source 100% of its pork that way by 2026 as outlined in an agreement with Green Century\u00b0 in 2023. Gestation crates are controversial because they harm animals and can also damage a company\u2019s reputation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"432\" height=\"288\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26802\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7.jpeg 432w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED7-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Reducing Single-use Plastic: Coca-Cola*, the largest soft drink company in the world, committed to disclosing its investments and successes in reusable bottle initiatives in response to a Green Century\u00b0 shareholder proposal. The company also agreed to continue to disclose quantitatively the share of beverages it sells in reusable containers. These commitments will help investors track the company\u2019s efforts to mitigate plastic-related risks and push for progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"630\" height=\"420\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8.jpeg 630w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED8-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Protecting the Climate: Green Century filed 12 climate-related shareholder proposals this year at major companies ranging from Amazon* to McDonald&#8217;s*<em>,<\/em> pressing the companies to disclose their full contribution to climate change, targets to reduce it, and plans to achieve those targets. We filed one of those resolutions at TD Bank* which led to the company pledging to evaluate its plans to reduce its carbon footprint as part of a broader governance review and clarify the climate expertise on its board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"508\" height=\"381\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26799\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10.jpeg 508w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED10-300x225.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Preserving Tropical Forests: Costco*, the third largest retailer in the world, will publish a comprehensive assessment and action plan to reduce deforestation in its Kirkland Signature brand products, protecting threatened species such as the jaguar and giant otter. Costco committed to publish the plan by 2025 after dialogue and withdrawal of a related shareholder proposal by Green Century\u00b0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"643\" height=\"429\" src=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26798\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11.jpeg 643w, https:\/\/www.greencentury.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Green-Century-Blog-1-10-2025_STAMPED-PDF-for-filing_STAMPED11-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Conserving Nature: The Okefenokee is the largest blackwater swamp in North America and one of the largest intact freshwater ecosystems in the world. Since 2021, Green Century\u00b0 has pressed chemical company Chemours* to avoid mining near the Okefenokee. Our advocacy amplified public backlash that helped push mining company Twin Pines Minerals, which had previously contracted with Chemours, to sell its Okefenokee-adjacent land to a conservation group instead. Green Century\u00b0&#8217;s related 2025 biodiversity resolution at Chemours won enough support to refile in future years and help keep mining away from the Okefenokee.<\/p>\n<div class=\"disclosures-content\"><p>\u00b0Green Century Capital Management, Inc.
